### Data Standardization :
**Definition:** Data standardization is a vital preparatory step in the data mining process, involving the conversion of raw data into a uniform format for consistent and compatible analysis across diverse sources. Key aspects include:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
    
    - Addresses missing values, corrects errors, and resolves inconsistencies to ensure high-quality data.
2. **Data Transformation:**
    
    - Involves scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and converting data types to achieve standardization.
3. **Normalization:**
    
    - Scales numerical attributes to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1) to prevent dominance in analysis due to varying scales.
4. **Feature Engineering:**
    
    - Creates or modifies features to enhance data quality and relevance for data mining tasks.
5. **Data Integration:**
    
    - Ensures consistency when integrating data from multiple sources, supporting coherent analysis.
6. **Data Governance:**
    
    - Implements policies for standardized data collection, storage, and management, facilitating effective data mining.
7. **Metadata Management:**
    
    - Maintains metadata describing data structure and meaning to help data miners understand context and characteristics.
