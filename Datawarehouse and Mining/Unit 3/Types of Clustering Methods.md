### Types of Clustering Methods
Below are the main clustering methods used in Machine learning:
1. Partitioning Clustering
2. Density-Based Clustering
3. Distribution Model-Based Clustering
4. Hierarchical Clustering
5. Fuzzy Clustering


**1. Partitioning Clustering:**

- **Definition:** Divides data into non-overlapping subsets (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one cluster.
- **Example:** K-Means is a common partitioning clustering method that separates data into 'k' clusters based on centroid similarity.

**2. Density-Based Clustering:**

- **Definition:** Forms clusters based on areas with higher data point density, accommodating clusters of various shapes and sizes.
- **Example:** DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) identifies dense regions and isolates less dense areas as noise.

**3. Distribution Model-Based Clustering:**

- **Definition:** Assumes data follows a specific statistical distribution and assigns clusters based on the likelihood of data points belonging to a distribution.
- **Example:** Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which models data using Gaussian distributions in Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).

**4. Hierarchical Clustering:**

- **Definition:** Creates a tree-like structure of clusters, starting with individual data points and gradually merging them into larger clusters.
- **Example:** Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering progressively combines clusters based on similarity.

**5. Fuzzy Clustering:**

- **Definition:** Allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership, introducing a level of uncertainty.
- **Example:** Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) assigns membership degrees to data points, reflecting the degree of association with each cluster.

Clustering is a technique used in data mining and machine learning to group a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (or cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. The goal is to partition a dataset into subsets, identifying inherent patterns or structures within the data without prior knowledge of the groupings.
