# ETL Process
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process extracts data from multiple sources, transforms it for consistency, and loads into a data warehouse for analysis and reporting.

- **Extracting:** data brought up from external sources
- **Transforming:** Fit the data as standard
- **Load:** Send data to Data warehouse

## Extract
  - Gather data from various sources (databases, files, APIs).
  - Analyze source data for patterns and quality issues.

## Transform
  - Clean data by removing duplicates, errors, and inconsistencies.
  - Restructure and normalize data to match the warehouse schema.
  - Enhance data by adding information or combining sources.

## Load
  - Load transformed data into the data warehouse.
  - Index data for optimized querying.
  - Verify and validate loaded data for accuracy.
