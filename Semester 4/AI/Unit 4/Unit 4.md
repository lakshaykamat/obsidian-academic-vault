To convert the statement "Good food is not cheap" into predicate logic or propositional logic, we first need to define our predicates and propositional symbols.

Let's define:

- \( G (x) \): \( x \) is good food.
- \( C (x) \): \( x \) is cheap.

Now, we can represent the statement using logical symbols:

### Predicate Logic:
\[ \neg \exists x (G (x) \land C (x)) \]
Translation: There does not exist any \( x \) such that \( x \) is good food and \( x \) is cheap.

### Propositional Logic:
\[ \neg (G \land C) \]
Translation: It is not the case that good food is cheap.

In both cases, we're expressing the idea that good food and cheapness do not coexist.
