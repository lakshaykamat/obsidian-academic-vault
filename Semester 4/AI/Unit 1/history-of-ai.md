# History of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a rich history, extending beyond recent advancements. The journey from its early concepts to present-day developments is marked by significant milestones:

## Maturation of Artificial Intelligence (1943-1952)

- **1943:** Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts propose a model of artificial neurons.
- **1949:** Donald Hebb introduces Hebbian learning, an updating rule for modifying connection strength between neurons.
- **1950:** Alan Turing pioneers machine learning, proposing the Turing test to assess a machine's intelligent behavior.

## The Birth of Artificial Intelligence (1952-1956)

- **1955:** Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon create the "Logic Theorist," the first AI program proving mathematical theorems.
- **1956:** John McCarthy adopts the term "Artificial Intelligence" at the Dartmouth Conference, marking its recognition as an academic field.

## The Golden Years - Early Enthusiasm (1956-1974)

- **1966:** Joseph Weizenbaum creates ELIZA, the first chatbot.
- **1972:** Japan builds WABOT-1, the first intelligent humanoid robot.

## The First AI Winter (1974-1980)

- A period marked by a shortage of government funding, leading to decreased interest and publicity.

## A Boom of AI (1980-1987)

- **1980:** AI resurgence with the introduction of "Expert Systems," emulating human decision-making.
- The first national conference of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence is held at Stanford University.

## The Second AI Winter (1987-1993)

- A period of reduced funding and interest due to high costs and less efficient results.

## The Emergence of Intelligent Agents (1993-2011)

- **1997:** IBM's Deep Blue beats world chess champion Gary Kasparov.
- **2002:** Roomba, the first home AI in the form of a vacuum cleaner.
- **2006:** Companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix integrate AI.

## Deep Learning, Big Data, and Artificial General Intelligence (2011-Present)

- **2011:** IBM's Watson wins Jeopardy, showcasing natural language understanding.
- **2012:** Google launches "Google Now," providing predictive information.
- **2014:** Chatbot "Eugene Goostman" wins the Turing test.
- **2018:** IBM's "Project Debater" performs well in complex debates.
- Google's "Duplex" demonstrates advanced virtual assistant capabilities.
