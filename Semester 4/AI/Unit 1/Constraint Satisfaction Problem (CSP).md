# Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
- CSP consists of three components V, D, C
- V is a set of variables {v 1, v 2 ,v 3.... Vn}
Constraint satisfaction (CSP) is a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with solving problems by identifying limitations and finding solutions that adhere to those limitations. Imagine you're coloring a map with different colors, and each bordering country cannot have the same color as its neighbor. This is a classic CSP example.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of constraint satisfaction problems:

- **Variables:** These represent the elements you need to assign values to. In the map coloring case, the variables are the countries.
- **Domains:** Each variable has a set of possible values it can take. For the countries, the domains would be the available colors.
- **Constraints:** These are the rules that restrict the possible combinations of values for the variables. In the map coloring case, the constraint is that neighboring countries cannot have the same color.

The goal of a CSP is to find an assignment of values to all variables such that all the constraints are satisfied. There are various algorithms used to solve CSPs, including:

- **Backtracking:** This is a depth-first search approach that systematically explores different value assignments for variables until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
- **Constraint propagation:** This technique reduces the search space by enforcing constraints and eliminating values that are guaranteed not to lead to a solution.

Constraint satisfaction problems have a wide range of applications in AI and beyond, including:

- **Scheduling:** Assigning tasks to resources while considering time constraints and dependencies.
- **Resource allocation:** Distributing limited resources among competing requests.
- **Planning:** Reasoning about actions and their outcomes to achieve a goal.
- **Game playing:** Developing strategies for games where there are rules and limitations on possible moves.
