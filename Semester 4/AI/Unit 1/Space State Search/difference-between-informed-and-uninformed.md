# Difference between informed and uninformed


|Parameters|Informed Search|Uninformed Search|
|---|---|---|
|Known as|It is also known as Heuristic Search.|It is also known as Blind Search.|
|Using Knowledge|It uses knowledge for the searching process.|It doesnâ€™t use knowledge for the searching process.|
|Performance|It finds a solution more quickly.|It finds solution slow as compared to an informed search.|
|Completion|It may or may not be complete.|It is always complete.|
|Cost Factor|Cost is low.|Cost is high.|
|Time|It consumes less time because of quick searching.|It consumes moderate time because of slow searching.|
|Direction|There is a direction given about the solution.|No suggestion is given regarding the solution in it.|
|Implementation|It is less lengthy while implemented.|It is more lengthy while implemented.|
|Efficiency|It is more efficient as efficiency takes into account cost and performance. The incurred cost is less and speed of finding solutions is quick.|It is comparatively less efficient as incurred cost is more and the speed of finding the Breadth-Firstsolution is slow.|
|Computational requirements|Computational requirements are lessened.|Comparatively higher computational requirements.|
|Size of search problems|Having a wide scope in terms of handling large search problems.|Solving a massive search task is challenging.|
