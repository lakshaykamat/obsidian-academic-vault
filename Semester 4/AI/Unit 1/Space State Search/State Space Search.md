## State Space Search in Artificial Intelligence

State space search is a technique used in artificial intelligence (AI) for problem-solving. ==It involves considering different possible configurations, or states, of a problem and searching for a sequence of actions that lead from the initial state to a desired goal state.==

### Key Concepts:

- **State Space:** Represents all possible situations or conditions a problem can be in.
- **Initial State:** The starting point of the search.
- **Goal State:** The desired end state.
- **Operators/Actions:** Options to move from one state to another.
- **Search Algorithm:** Method to efficiently explore the state space and find a path to the goal state.

### Categories of Search Algorithms:

1. **Uninformed Search:**
   - Explore the state space without knowledge of the goal state.
   - Examples: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search.

2. **Informed Search:**
   - Use information about the goal state to guide the search.
   - Examples: A* search, heuristic search.

### Applications in AI:

- **Game Playing:** Explore possible moves and strategies in games like chess or Go.
- **Robotics:** Plan movements and navigate environments.
- **Planning and Scheduling:** Create plans and schedules to achieve specific goals.
