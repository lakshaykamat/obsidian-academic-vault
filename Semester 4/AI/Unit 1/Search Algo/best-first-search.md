## Best-First Search Algorithm

The Best-First Search algorithm is a powerful tool in AI for finding optimal paths in graphs or trees. It prioritizes nodes based on a heuristic function, guiding the search towards promising paths.

### Key Components:

- **Open List:** Stores unexplored nodes, sorted by their f-score (combination of actual cost and estimated cost).
- **Closed List:** Stores explored nodes to avoid revisiting them.
- **Heuristic Function (h (n)):** Estimates remaining cost to reach the goal from a node.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Initialization:**
    - Define start and goal nodes.
    - Create Open and Closed Lists.
    - Calculate h (n) for start node and add to Open List with f-score = h (n).

2. **Iteration:**
    - Until goal is found or Open List is empty:
        - Remove node with lowest f-score from Open List.
        - Add to Closed List.
        - For each neighbor:
            - If not in Closed List:
                - Calculate g (n) (cost from current node).
                - Estimate h (n) using heuristic.
                - Calculate f-score (f (n) = g (n) + h (n)).
                - Add to Open List with calculated f-score.
                - Update if already in Open List with lower f-score.

3. **Goal Check:**
    - If goal is in Closed List, search successful.
    - Trace path back using parent pointers.

### Example:

For the 8-puzzle problem:
- **States:** Tile arrangements.
- **Actions:** Moving tiles.
- **Heuristic:** Manhattan distance to goal.

### Advantages:

- **Finds optimal paths efficiently:** Prioritizes promising paths.
- **Adaptable:** Various heuristic functions can be used.

### Limitations:

- **Heuristic dependence:** Accuracy of heuristic crucial.
- **Memory usage:** Storing explored states can be memory-intensive.

### Further Exploration:

- **A* Search:** Combines Best-First with actual cost, often yielding optimal paths.
- **Heuristic Design:** Crucial for optimal performance.
- **Implementation:** Various data structures and techniques available.
- **Variations:** Address specific limitations or adapt to different problems.
