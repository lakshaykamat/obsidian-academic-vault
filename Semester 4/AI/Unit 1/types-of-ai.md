## AI Type-1: Based on Capabilities

### 1. Weak AI or Narrow AI:
   - Performs specific tasks with intelligence.
   - Limited to a predefined range of functions.
   - Examples: Apple Siri, IBM's Watson.

### 2. General AI:
   - Capable of performing any intellectual task efficiently.
   - Aims to mimic human intelligence across various tasks.
   - Currently in the research phase; no system achieves true general AI.

### 3. Super AI:
   - Surpasses human intelligence, excelling in cognitive properties.
   - Hypothetical and represents the highest level of AI development.
   - Envisions machines with advanced problem-solving, reasoning, and learning capabilities.

## AI Type-2: Based on Functionality

### 1. Reactive Machines:
   - Reacts to current scenarios without storing memories.
   - Basic AI used for specific tasks.
   - Examples: IBM's Deep Blue, Google's AlphaGo.

### 2. Limited Memory:
   - Stores past experiences or data for a limited period.
   - Utilizes stored data for decision-making within a specified timeframe.
   - Examples: Self-driving cars, which store recent data for navigation.

### 3. Theory of Mind:
   - AI with an understanding of human emotions, beliefs, and social interactions.
   - Currently under research, aiming to develop AI with social awareness.

### 4. Self-Awareness:
   - Hypothetical AI with superintelligence, consciousness, and self-awareness.
   - Envisions machines surpassing human cognitive capabilities.
   - Currently a theoretical concept without real-world implementation.

Understanding these types provides a comprehensive view of the diverse capabilities and functionalities that AI can exhibit.
