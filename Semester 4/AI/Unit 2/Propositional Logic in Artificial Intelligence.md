# Propositional Logic in AI

[Propositional Logic in Artificial Intelligence - Javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/propositional-logic-in-artificial-intelligence)

Propositional logic (PL) is the simplest form of logic where statements are made by propositions, which are declarative statements that are either true or false. It's a technique of knowledge representation in a logical and mathematical form.

## Example:
- It is Sunday.
- The Sun rises from the West (False proposition).
- 3+3=7 (False proposition).
- 5 is a prime number.

### Basic Facts about Propositional Logic:

- Also known as Boolean logic, operating on 0 and 1.
- Uses symbolic variables (e.g., A, B, P, Q) to represent propositions.
- Propositions are either true or false, not both.
- Consists of propositions, connectives, and logical operators.
- Connectives include negation, conjunction, disjunction, implication, and biconditional.

## Syntax of Propositional Logic:

- **Atomic Propositions:** Simple propositions consisting of a single symbol.
	- Examples
	- 2+2=4 (True)
	- This sun is cold (False)
- **Compound Propositions:** Constructed by combining atomic propositions using logical connectives.
	- Examples:
	- It is raining today, and street is wet
	- Aman is a doctor, and his clinic in New York

### Logical Connectives:

- **Negation (¬):** Represents the opposite of a proposition.
- **Conjunction (∧):** Represents the logical "and" operation.
- **Disjunction (∨):** Represents the logical "or" operation.
- **Implication (→):** Represents "if-then" rules.
- **Biconditional (⇔):** Represents logical equivalence.

### Truth Table:

- Tabular representation of all possible combinations of truth values for propositions.
- Helps in evaluating compound propositions with logical connectives.

### Precedence of Connectives:

1. Parenthesis
2. Negation
3. Conjunction (AND)
4. Disjunction (OR)
5. Implication
6. Biconditional

### Logical Equivalence:

- Two propositions are equivalent if their truth values are identical in all scenarios.
- Demonstrated through truth tables.

### Properties of Operators:

- **Commutativity**
- **Associativity**
- **Identity element**
- **Distributive**
- **De Morgan's Law**
- **Double-negation elimination**

### Limitations:

- Cannot represent relationships like "ALL," "some," or "none."
- Limited expressive power compared to more advanced logics.
