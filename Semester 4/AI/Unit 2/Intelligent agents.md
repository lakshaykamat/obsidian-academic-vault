# Intelligent Agent

An agent in AI is any entity capable of perceiving its environment and taking actions to achieve goals. An intelligent agent is a special type of agent equipped with the ability to learn from experience, adapt its behavior, and make decisions autonomously, often utilizing advanced reasoning and problem-solving techniques.

## Goals of an Agent

1. **High Performance:** Striving to accomplish tasks efficiently and effectively.
2. **Optimized Result:** Seeking the best possible outcome or solution.
3. **Rational Action:** Making decisions based on logical reasoning and expected outcomes.

### Components of an Agent:

- **P** -> Performance
- **E** -> Environment
- **A** -> Actions
- **S** -> Sensors

## Types of Agents

1. **Simple Reflex Agent:**
   - Reacts spontaneously to environmental stimuli.
   - Responds based solely on the current perception without considering past experiences.
   - Operates using if-then rules.
   - Environment should be fully observable.

2. **Model-Based Reflex Agent:**
   - Deals with partially observable environments.
   - Maintains an internal model by storing percept history.

3. **Goal-Based Agent:**
   - Builds upon the model-based reflex agent.
   - Describes situations using goals.
   - Engages in searching and planning to achieve these goals.

4. **Utility-Based Agents:**
   - Focuses on maximizing utility or satisfaction of goals.
   - Operates with a utility function to evaluate actions.
   - Handles both positive and negative states, aiming to achieve the most desirable outcome.
