DStatistical distributions, also known as probability distributions, describe the likelihood of various outcomes or events in a dataset. Different distributions have unique shapes and characteristics, making them suitable for modeling different types of data. Here are some common statistical distributions:

### 1. **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)**

- **Shape:** Bell-shaped curve symmetrical around the mean.
- **Properties:** Mean, median, and mode are equal. It is characterized by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).
- **Applications:** Widely used in statistics, natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering to model continuous data.

### 2. **Binomial Distribution**

- **Shape:** Discrete probability distribution with a symmetric or skewed shape, depending on the values of parameters (n and p).
- **Properties:** Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
- **Applications:** Used to model binary outcomes (success/failure) in experiments or processes with a fixed number of trials.

### 3. **Poisson Distribution**

- **Shape:** Discrete probability distribution with a skewed shape.
- **Properties:** Describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
- **Applications:** Used to model the number of occurrences of rare events, such as accidents, arrivals, or defects, in a fixed interval.

### 4. **Exponential Distribution**

- **Shape:** Continuous probability distribution with a right-skewed shape.
- **Properties:** Describes the time between successive events in a Poisson process (memoryless property).
- **Applications:** Used to model the time between events in various processes, such as waiting times, failure times, or arrival times in queues.

### 5. **Uniform Distribution**

- **Shape:** Continuous probability distribution with a rectangular shape.
- **Properties:** All outcomes are equally likely within a specified range.
- **Applications:** Used when all outcomes are equally likely, such as random number generation, simulations, and sampling.

### 6. **Gamma Distribution**

- **Shape:** Continuous probability distribution with a right-skewed shape.
- **Properties:** Generalization of the exponential distribution, often used to model waiting times and durations.
- **Applications:** Used in reliability engineering, queuing theory, and survival analysis.

### 7. **Chi-Square Distribution**

- **Shape:** Continuous probability distribution with a right-skewed shape.
- **Properties:** Derived from the sum of squared standard normal random variables.
- **Applications:** Commonly used in hypothesis testing, particularly in testing goodness of fit and testing independence in contingency tables.

### 8. **Student's t-Distribution**

- **Shape:** Continuous probability distribution with a bell-shaped curve similar to the normal distribution but with heavier tails.
- **Properties:** Widely used for hypothesis testing when the sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown.
- **Applications:** Used in statistical inference, particularly in t-tests and confidence intervals for small sample sizes.

These are just a few examples of statistical distributions commonly encountered in data analysis, modeling, and hypothesis testing. Each distribution has its own set of properties and applications, allowing statisticians and data scientists to model and analyze various types of data effectively.
