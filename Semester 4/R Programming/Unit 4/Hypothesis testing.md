# Hypothesis testing
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. In R, hypothesis testing can be performed using various functions and packages, depending on the type of hypothesis being tested and the nature of the data. Here's an overview of hypothesis testing in R:

### 1. **Null and Alternative Hypotheses**

- **Definition:** In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis (H 0) represents the default assumption, while the alternative hypothesis (Ha) represents the claim or assertion we are testing.

### 2. **Statistical Tests in R**

#### a. Parametric Tests

- **T-tests:** Used to compare means between two groups.
  - **Functions:** `t.test()`

- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Used to compare means among more than two groups.
  - **Function:** `aov()` in base R or `anova()`.

- **Linear Regression:** Used to analyze the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable.
  - **Function:** `lm()`

#### b. Non-parametric Tests

- **Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test:** Used to compare paired samples when the data does not meet the assumptions of the paired t-test.
  - **Function:** `wilcox.test()`

- **Mann-Whitney U Test:** Used to compare independent samples when the data does not meet the assumptions of the t-test.
  - **Function:** `wilcox.test()` with the `paired` argument set to `FALSE`.

- **Kruskal-Wallis Test:** Non-parametric alternative to one-way ANOVA for comparing more than two independent groups.
  - **Function:** `kruskal.test()`

### 3. **Steps in Hypothesis Testing in R**

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:** Define the null and alternative hypotheses based on the research question.

2. **Choose a Test:** Select an appropriate statistical test based on the type of data and the hypotheses being tested.

3. **Perform the Test:** Use the corresponding R function to perform the hypothesis test, providing the necessary arguments such as sample data and test conditions.

4. **Interpret the Results:** Examine the test statistic, p-value, and any other relevant output to determine whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

5. **Draw Conclusions:** Based on the results of the hypothesis test, make inferences about the population parameter and interpret the findings in the context of the research question.

### Example:

```R
# Example data
group1 <- c(25, 30, 35, 40, 45)
group2 <- c(20, 25, 30, 35, 40)

# Perform t-test
result <- t.test(group1, group2)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

In this example, we perform a t-test to compare the means of two groups (`group1` and `group2`). The `t.test()` function calculates the test statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value. Based on the p-value, we can determine whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Hypothesis testing in R allows researchers and analysts to draw conclusions from data and make informed decisions based on statistical evidence.
