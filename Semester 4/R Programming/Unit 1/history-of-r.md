## History of R
The history of R dates back about 20-30 years. Developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, R is currently maintained by the R Development Core Team. The language's name is derived from the initials of both developers. The first project commenced in 1992, and the initial version was released in 1995. A stable beta version was introduced in 2000.
