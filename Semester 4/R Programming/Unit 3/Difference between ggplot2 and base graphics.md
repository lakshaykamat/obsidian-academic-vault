# Difference between ggplot 2 and base graphics
Base graphics and ggplot 2 are two different systems in R for creating plots and visualizations. Here's a comparison of the two:

### Base Graphics:

1. **Built-in to R:** Base graphics are part of the base R package and come pre-installed with R.
  
2. **Simple Syntax:** Base graphics use a simple syntax for creating plots directly from data frames or vectors.

3. **Limited Flexibility:** While base graphics are easy to use for simple plots, they offer limited flexibility and customization options compared to ggplot 2.

4. **Procedural Approach:** Base graphics follow a procedural approach, where individual functions (e.g., `plot()`, `hist()`, `boxplot()`) are used to create and customize each component of the plot.

5. **Quick Prototyping:** Base graphics are suitable for quick prototyping and exploration of data, especially for users who are already familiar with R.

### Ggplot 2:

1. **External Package:** ggplot 2 is an external package in R developed by Hadley Wickham, which needs to be installed and loaded separately (`install.packages("ggplot2")`).

2. **Grammar of Graphics:** ggplot 2 follows the grammar of graphics concept, which provides a structured and consistent framework for creating plots. It involves mapping data to aesthetics (e.g., x-axis, y-axis, color, size), specifying geometric objects (e.g., points, lines, bars), and adding layers of customization.

3. **Highly Customizable:** ggplot 2 offers a high level of customization, allowing users to create complex and highly customizable plots with relatively simple syntax.

4. **Layered Approach:** ggplot 2 follows a layered approach, where different components of the plot (data, aesthetics, geometries, scales, themes) are added in layers, making it easy to modify and refine plots.

5. **Publication-Quality Plots:** ggplot 2 is widely used for creating publication-quality plots in research papers, reports, and presentations due to its aesthetic appeal and customization options.

### Comparison:

- Base graphics are suitable for quick and simple plots, while ggplot 2 is preferred for creating more complex and customized plots.
- Base graphics are built-in and readily available, while ggplot 2 requires installation of an external package.
- Base graphics follow a procedural approach, while ggplot 2 follows a grammar of graphics approach.
- Base graphics offer limited customization options, while ggplot 2 offers extensive customization capabilities.
- Base graphics may be preferred by users who are already familiar with R, while ggplot 2 may be preferred by users who prioritize aesthetics and flexibility.

In summary, the choice between base graphics and ggplot 2 depends on the user's preference, the complexity of the plot, and the level of customization required. Both systems have their strengths and are widely used in the R community for creating visualizations.
