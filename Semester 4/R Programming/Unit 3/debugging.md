# Debugging techniques in R 

**Inspecting Values:**

- **Print statements:** Quickly check variable values at different points in your code (`print(x)`).

**Pausing Execution:**

- **Browser function (`browser()`):** Pause execution and enter an interactive mode to examine variables and the program state.

**Stepping Through Code:**

- **Debug function (`debug(function_name)`):** Execute a function line by line, allowing you to inspect variables and make changes during execution.

**Understanding Errors:**

- **Traceback:** Analyze the sequence of function calls that led to an error (`traceback()`).

**Additional Techniques:**

- **`recover()`:** Enter a debugging environment within a function when an error occurs (advanced users).
- **`trace()`:** Add custom code that runs whenever a specific function is called (advanced users).
- **RStudio debugger:** Leverage RStudio's features for debugging (breakpoints, stepping, variable inspection).

**Advanced Practices:**

- **Unit testing:** Write tests to ensure functions behave as expected (package `testthat`).
- **Code profiling:** Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize code (`Rprof()` and `profvis`).
- **Try-catch blocks:** Handle errors gracefully and prevent program crashes.

**Remember:**

- Use `print` for quick value checks.
- Use `browser` for in-depth debugging and stepping through code.
- Combine these techniques for effective debugging.
