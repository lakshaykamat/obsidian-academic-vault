Both `lapply()` and `sapply()` are functions in R used to apply a function to each element of a list, vector, or data frame. However, they differ slightly in their output:

### 1. lapply()

- **Function:** Applies a function to each element of an object and returns a list of the same length as the input object.
- **Output:** A list, where each element is the result of applying the function to the corresponding element in the input object.

**Example:**

```R
# Square each element in a vector
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
squared_numbers <- lapply(numbers, function(x) x^2)

print(squared_numbers)
# [[1]] 1
# [[2]] 4
# [[3]] 9
# [[4]] 16
```

Here, `lapply()` applies the anonymous function `function(x) x^2` to each element in `numbers`, resulting in a list containing the squares of each number.

### 2. Sapply ()

- **Function:** Similar to `lapply()`, it applies a function to each element of an object.
- **Output:** Attempts to simplify the output to the most appropriate data structure.
    - If the input is a vector and the function returns a single value for each element, the output will also be a vector.
    - If the input is a list or data frame and the function returns a vector for each element, the output will be a list of vectors.
    - Otherwise, it will return a list.

**Example:**

```R
# Extract the length of each character vector in a list
names <- list("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
lengths <- sapply(names, nchar)

print(lengths)
# [1] 5 3 7
```

In this case, `sapply()` applies `nchar()` (which returns the length of a character vector) to each element in the `names` list. Since `nchar()` returns a single value (length) for each element, the output is simplified to a vector containing the lengths of each character string.

**Choosing Between lapply () and sapply ()**

- Use `lapply()` when you specifically need the output to be a list, regardless of the function's return type for each element.
- Use `sapply()` when you expect the function to return a single value for each element, and you want the output to be simplified to a vector (for vectors) or a list of vectors (for lists/data frames).

Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

| Feature           | lapply ()                                 | sapply ()                                   |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Function          | Applies a function to each element      | Applies a function to each element         |
| Output            | List                                     | Tries to simplify the output to a vector or list |
| Use Case          | Always need the output as a list        | Function returns a single value for each element |
