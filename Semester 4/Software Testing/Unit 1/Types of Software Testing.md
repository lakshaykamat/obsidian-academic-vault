## Types of Software Testing

Software testing can be broadly classified into three main types:

### 1. Functional Testing:
   - Validates software systems against functional requirements.
   - Ensures that the application works as per specified functional requirements.
   - Includes Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, Smoke Testing, and more.

### 2. Non-functional Testing:
   - Checks the application for non-functional requirements like performance, scalability, portability, and stress.
   - Focuses on aspects beyond functionality.
   - Includes Performance Testing, Stress Testing, Usability Testing, and more.

### 3. Maintenance Testing:
   - Involves changing, modifying, and updating the software to meet customer needs.
   - Includes regression testing to verify that recent changes have not adversely affected previously working parts of the software.

## Additional Classifications:

### Manual Testing:
  - Testing software manually without using automation tools.
  - Testers take on the role of end-users to identify unexpected behavior or bugs.
  - Includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
  - Involves the use of test plans, test cases, and test scenarios.
  - Encompasses exploratory testing, where testers explore the software to identify errors.

### Automation Testing:
  - Also known as Test Automation.
  - Involves writing scripts and using automation tools to test the product.
  - Automates manual testing processes for efficiency.
  - Used for regression testing and testing from a load, performance, and stress perspective.
  - Increases test coverage, improves accuracy, and saves time and money compared to manual testing.
