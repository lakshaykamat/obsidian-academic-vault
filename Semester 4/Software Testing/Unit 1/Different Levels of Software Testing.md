# Different Levels of Software Testing

Software testing is organized into four main levels, each serving a specific purpose:

## Unit Testing:
   - Focuses on testing individual units or components of a software/system.
   - Validates that each unit performs as designed.
   - Performed at the lowest level of the software hierarchy.

## Integration Testing:
   - Combines individual units and tests them as a group.
   - Aims to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.
   - Ensures that components work together seamlessly.

## System Testing:
   - Involves testing the complete, integrated system or software.
   - Evaluates the system's compliance with specified requirements.
   - Tests the system as a whole, including its overall functionality.

## Acceptance Testing:
   - Focuses on testing the system for acceptability.
   - Assesses whether the system meets business requirements.
   - Determines whether the system is acceptable for delivery to end-users.
