# Different Types of Software Testing Techniques

Software testing techniques can be broadly classified into two main categories:

## Black Box Testing  
   - Conducted without access to the source code.
   - Focuses on testing the software at the interface level.
   - Tester is unaware of the internal logical structure of the software.
   - Emphasizes external behavior and functionality.
   - Examples include functional testing, acceptance testing, and system testing.

## White Box Testing
   - Conducted with full access to the source code.
   - Tester is aware of the internal workings of the product.
   - Ensures that all internal operations conform to specifications.
   - Emphasizes internal logic, code structure, and paths.
   - Examples include unit testing, integration testing, and code coverage testing.

## Grey Box Testing  
   - Testers have partial knowledge of the implementation details.
   - Intermediate level of testing knowledge, falling between black box and white box testing.
   - Combines aspects of both black box and white box testing.
   - Testers may have access to high-level design documents.
   - Helps in finding defects related to improper interaction between components.
