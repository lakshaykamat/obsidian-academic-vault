# Programming Paradigms
A programming paradigm is a fundamental style of programming that defines a way to structure computer programs and solve problems. 

It offers a set of principles, concepts and techniques that influence how a programmer approaches a problem and how the code is written.
## 1. Procedural programming:
This is a subset of imperative programming where code is organized into procedures or functions, which promote modularity and reusability. It focuses on breaking down a program into a series of procedures or functions that can be called by other parts of the program. Examples of procedural languages include C and FORTRAN.

## 2. Object-oriented programming (OOP):
This paradigm organizes code around objects, which are self-contained entities that group data (attributes) and related operations (methods) that operate on that data. Object-oriented programming is based on the idea that programs are made up of objects that interact with each other. Examples of object-oriented languages include Java, C++, and Python.

## 3. Functional programming:
This paradigm focuses on defining functions that transform data, with an emphasis on immutability (avoiding side effects). Functional programs are built by composing pure functions, avoiding side effects, and manipulating data through function calls. Examples of functional languages include Haskell, Lisp, and Scala.  
## 4. Declarative programming:
This paradigm focuses on specifying what the program should achieve rather than how it should achieve it. The programmer describes the desired outcome, and the system figures out how to carry it out. Examples of declarative languages include SQL (for database queries) and HTML (for web page structure).
