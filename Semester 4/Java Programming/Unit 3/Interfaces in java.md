# Interface
In Java, interfaces are a fundamental concept for achieving abstraction and promoting loose coupling. Here's a breakdown of what interfaces are and how they're used:

## What are Interfaces?
An interface is a blueprint that specifies what a class must do (behavior) without specifying how it will do it (implementation). Interfaces contain:

- **Method signatures:** These declare the names, parameters, and return type of methods, but don't include the method body (implementation).
- **Constants:** Interface constants are static final by default, meaning their values are fixed and shared across all classes implementing the interface.

## Key Points about Interfaces:
- **Cannot be instantiated:** You cannot directly create objects of an interface.
- **Implemented by classes:** Classes can "implement" an interface, agreeing to provide the functionality defined by the interface methods.
- **Multiple inheritance:** A class can implement multiple interfaces, inheriting behaviors from each.
- **Polymorphism:** Interfaces enable polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes that implement the same interface to be treated interchangeably through the interface type.

## Benefits of Using Interfaces:
- **Abstraction:** Interfaces hide implementation details, focusing on what a class can do.
- **Loose coupling:** Classes depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations, making them more flexible and adaptable to changes.
- **Code reusability:** Interfaces promote code reusability as multiple classes can implement the same interface.
- **Improved maintainability:** Interfaces make code easier to understand and maintain by separating concerns.

## Common Use Cases for Interfaces:
- Defining standard behaviors for different object types (e.g., `Drawable` interface for drawing functionalities).
- Enabling loose coupling in frameworks and libraries (e.g., database access interfaces).
- Implementing callback mechanisms (e.g., listener interfaces).
