# Packages In Java
Packages in Java are essentially a way to organize code into logical groupings. They function like folders in a file system, bundling related classes, interfaces, and even sub-packages together.

There are two main types of packages in Java:

## Built-in Packages (Java API):
These come pre-defined with the Java installation and provide a rich library of classes for various functionalities. Some common examples include:
    - `java.lang`: Contains fundamental classes like `System`, `String`, `Math`, etc.
    - `java.io`: Provides classes for input/output operations like `File`, `Reader`, `Writer`, etc.
    - `java.util`: Offers utility classes like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `Scanner`, etc.
## User-defined Packages:
You can create your own packages to organize your code. This is particularly helpful for larger projects where maintaining code structure becomes crucial. User-defined packages follow a naming convention similar to domain names (e.g., `com.mycompany.myapp`).

### Benefits
- **Preventing Naming Conflicts:** With packages, you can have multiple classes with the same name as long as they reside in different packages. This eliminates confusion and potential errors.
- **Improved Code Organization:** Packages group related functionalities together, making your codebase more organized and easier to navigate.
- **Enhanced Reusability:** You can reuse classes and interfaces within a package or import them from other packages for wider use in your project.
- **Access Control:** Packages provide a level of access control. Classes can be declared as `public` (accessible from anywhere), `private` (accessible only within the package), or `protected` (accessible within the package and subclasses).

Overall, packages are a cornerstone of writing clean, maintainable, and reusable Java code.
