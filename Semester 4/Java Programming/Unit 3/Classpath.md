# Classpath
The classpath in Java is an environment variable that tells the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) where to find the libraries and classes it needs to run a Java program. It is a list of directories and JAR files, separated by semicolons. The JVM searches for classes in the order they are listed in the classpath.

## Here are some of the reasons why the classpath is important in Java:

### To locate and load classes:
The JVM uses the classpath to locate and load the classes that are needed to run a Java program.    
### To prevent naming conflicts:
The classpath can help to prevent naming conflicts between classes from different packages.
    
### To provide controlled access:
The classpath can be used to control access to classes and packages. For example, you can use the classpath to prevent a class from being accessed by other classes.
