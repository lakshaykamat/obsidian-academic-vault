## Explain Programming Paradigms

### Imperative Programming Paradigm:
Imperative programming is one of the oldest styles, closely tied to how computers work. It follows a step-by-step approach, changing the program's state through assignments. The focus is on detailing how to achieve a goal.

**Advantages:**
- Simple to understand and implement.
- Includes familiar constructs like loops and variables.

**Disadvantages:**
- Can struggle with complex problems.
- Often less efficient and productive.
- Hard to do parallel programming.

Examples: C, Fortran, Basic

### Procedural Programming Paradigm:
Procedural programming shares similarities with imperative programming but emphasizes reusable procedures or functions.

**Advantages:**
- Code reusability improves productivity.
- Good for structuring medium-sized projects.

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited for solving complex problems.
- Not the best for parallel programming.

Examples: C, C++, Java, Pascal

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
OOP organizes code into objects with data (attributes) and behaviors (methods), allowing for easier problem-solving by modeling real-world entities.

**Advantages:**
- Encourages code reusability and modularity.
- Provides data security through encapsulation.
- Supports inheritance for code organization.
- Promotes flexible design through abstraction.

Examples: Java, C++, Python

### Declarative Programming Paradigm:
Declarative programming focuses on what needs to be done rather than how to do it, simplifying program logic.

#### Logic Programming:
Solves logical problems using a knowledge base and queries, resembling mathematical proofs.

**Advantages:**
- Natural for solving logical problems.
- Simplifies parallel programming.

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited outside of logical problem-solving.
- Can be less efficient for certain tasks.

Examples: Prolog

#### Functional Programming:
Executes a series of mathematical functions, emphasizing function purity and immutability.

**Advantages:**
- Promotes clean, bug-resistant code.
- Easier to understand and debug.
- Supports parallel processing well.

**Disadvantages:**
- Can have a steep learning curve.
- Not ideal for tasks requiring mutable state.

Examples: Haskell, JavaScript, Scala

## Write a java program to demonstrate the use of constructur
```java
// Define a class named "Car"
class Car {
    String brand;
    String model;
    int year;

    // Constructor without parameters (default constructor)
    Car() {
        brand = "Toyota";
        model = "Corolla";
        year = 2020;
    }

    // Constructor with parameters
    Car(String brand, String model, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method to display car information
    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand);
        System.out.println("Model: " + model);
        System.out.println("Year: " + year);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a car using the default constructor
        Car car1 = new Car();

        // Display car information
        System.out.println("Car 1:");
        car1.displayInfo();
        System.out.println();

        // Create a car using the parameterized constructor
        Car car2 = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2019);

        // Display car information
        System.out.println("Car 2:");
        car2.displayInfo();
    }
}

```
## Explain Operators in java
Operators in Java are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They are the building blocks that manipulate data and control the flow of your program. Java has several different types of operators, each with a specific purpose:

### 1 . Arithmetic Operators:
These perform mathematical calculations on numbers. They include:

* `+`: Addition
* `-`: Subtraction
* `*`: Multiplication
* `/`: Division
* `%`: Modulo (remainder after division)

### 2 . Assignment Operators:

These assign values to variables. The basic assignment operator is `=`, but there are compound assignment operators that combine assignment with other operations, like `+=` (add and assign) or `-=` (subtract and assign).

### 3 . Relational Operators:
These compare two values and return true or false based on the comparison. Examples include:

* `==`: Equal to
* `!=`: Not equal to
* `<`: Less than
* `>`: Greater than
* `<=`: Less than or equal to
* `>=`: Greater than or equal to

### 4 . Logical Operators:

These combine Boolean expressions (true or false) to form more complex conditions. They include:

* `&&`: AND (both conditions must be true)
* `||`: OR (at least one condition must be true)
* `!`: NOT (inverts the truth value)

### 5 . Unary Operators:
These operate on a single operand. Examples include:

* `++`: Increment (adds 1 to a value)
* `--`: Decrement (subtracts 1 from a value)
* `-`: Negation (negates a value)
* `!`: Logical NOT (inverts the truth value)

### 6 . Bitwise Operators:

These perform bit-level operations on integers. They are less common but useful for low-level programming tasks.

### 7 . Shift Operators:
These shift the bits of a value left or right. They are also used in bit manipulation.

### 8 . Ternary Operator:

This is a shorthand for an if-else statement. It allows writing a condition and assigning a value based on the outcome in a single line.

### Precedence and Associativity:
Java follows a specific order of operations (precedence) to evaluate expressions. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. For example, multiplication happens before addition.  When operators have the same precedence, associativity determines which side is evaluated first (usually left to right).

Understanding these operators is essential for writing Java programs. They form the foundation for manipulating data, making decisions, and controlling the flow of your code.



## What is an Interface? Pro grammatically ways to create interface

An interface in programming acts like a contract. It defines a set of functionalities (methods) that a class must implement. It specifies what a class can do, but not how it does it. This promotes loose coupling, meaning the class implementing the interface can provide its own specific implementation details without affecting the overall functionality.

### 1. Using the `interface` keyword (most common):

This is the standard way to declare an interface. Here's the syntax (generalized):

```plaintext
interface InterfaceName {
  // Method declarations (abstract by default)
  returnType methodName(parameter1, parameter2, ...);
  // You can also have constant declarations
  final int CONSTANT_VALUE = 10;
}
```

- `interface`: Keyword to define an interface.
- `InterfaceName`:  Name of your interface (should follow naming conventions).
- `// Method declarations`: These are the functionalities the implementing class must provide. They are declared without a body (abstract by default).
- `returnType`: The data type returned by the method.
- `methodName`: The name of the method.
- `parameter1, parameter2, ...`: Optional parameters the method can accept.
- `// You can also have constant declarations`: Interfaces can hold constants (final by default). 

### 2. Using an abstract class (less common):

While less common, some languages allow defining an interface using an abstract class that only declares abstract methods. Here's a simplified example:

```plaintext
abstract class InterfaceName {
  // Abstract method declarations
  abstract returnType methodName(parameter1, parameter2, ...);
}
```

- `abstract class`: Keyword to define an abstract class. 
- `InterfaceName`: Name of your interface following naming conventions (often starts with "I").
- `// Abstract method declarations`: Similar to the interface approach, these methods have no body.

**Key points:**

- Interfaces promote code reusability and loose coupling.
- They enforce a contract that classes must follow. 
-  The first approach (`interface` keyword) is the preferred way for creating interfaces in most languages.

## What is stream? Explain various I/O stream classes
In programming, a stream refers to a sequence of data that is read from a source or written to a destination. It's like a flowing river of information. Streams are fundamental for performing input/output (I/O) operations in your programs.

There are two main categories of streams:

1. **Input Streams:** These are used to read data from a source, such as a file, keyboard, network connection, or any other data producer.

2. **Output Streams:** These are used to write data to a destination, such as a file, console, network connection, or any other data consumer.

Java provides a robust I/O Stream API in the `java.io` package. This API offers various stream classes to handle different data types and I/O scenarios. Here's a breakdown of some common I/O stream classes:

**A. Byte Streams:**

* **InputStream:** This is the abstract base class for all input streams. It defines methods for reading bytes of data.
* **OutputStream:** This is the abstract base class for all output streams. It defines methods for writing bytes of data.
* **FileInputStream:** This class allows reading bytes from a file. 
* **FileOutputStream:** This class allows writing bytes to a file.
* **ByteArrayInputStream:** This class allows reading bytes from a byte array in memory.
* **ByteArrayOutputStream:** This class allows writing bytes to a byte array in memory.

**B. Character Streams:**

* **Reader:** This is the abstract base class for all character streams. It defines methods for reading characters (Unicode).
* **Writer:** This is the abstract base class for all character streams. It defines methods for writing characters (Unicode).
* **FileReader:** This class allows reading characters from a file.
* **FileWriter:** This class allows writing characters to a file.
* **CharArrayReader:** This class allows reading characters from a character array in memory.
* **CharArrayWriter:** This class allows writing characters to a character array in memory.

**C. Other Stream Classes:**

* **BufferedInputStream/BufferedOutputStream:** These classes wrap existing input/output streams and provide buffering for improved performance.
* **DataInputStream/DataOutputStream:** These classes allow reading/writing primitive data types (int, float, etc.) from/to streams.
* **PrintStream:** This convenience class provides methods for printing formatted output to streams like the console.
* **Scanner:** This class simplifies reading formatted input (like user input) from streams.

These are just some of the commonly used I/O stream classes in Java. The specific classes you'll use depend on the type of data you're working with (bytes or characters) and the source/destination of your data (files, network, etc.).

Remember, using streams effectively involves opening the stream, processing the data (reading from or writing to it), and then closing the stream to release resources.

## Thread lifecycle
A thread in programming is like a mini-program within a program. It allows a program to execute multiple tasks concurrently, improving its responsiveness and performance. Imagine a single chef in a kitchen trying to juggle multiple dishes at once. Threads are like extra chefs that can help prepare different parts of the meal simultaneously.

Here's the lifecycle of a thread, which defines the various stages it goes through during its execution:

1. **New:** This is the initial state when a thread object is first created. The code hasn't begun execution yet.

2. **Runnable:** Once the `start()` method is called on the thread object, it moves to the runnable state. This means the thread is ready to be run by the thread scheduler, a part of the operating system that manages multiple threads.

3. **Running:** When the thread scheduler assigns the CPU (processor) to the thread, it moves to the running state. This is where the thread's code is actually being executed.

4. **Waiting/Blocked:** A thread can enter the waiting state for various reasons. For instance, it might be waiting for another thread to finish a task or waiting for I/O operations (like reading from a file) to complete. In the blocked state, the thread is unable to run because it's waiting for a specific resource.

5. **Timed Waiting:** Similar to waiting, a thread can enter a timed waiting state if it uses methods that specify a waiting time limit.

6. **Terminated:** Finally, when the thread finishes its execution or encounters an error, it moves to the terminated state. The resources associated with the thread are released at this point.

It's important to note that multiple threads can be in the runnable state at the same time. The thread scheduler determines which runnable thread gets the CPU for a specific time slice. This allows the program to appear as if it's handling multiple tasks simultaneously, even though only one thread can be running on the CPU at a given moment.

Understanding thread lifecycles is crucial for writing multithreaded programs effectively. It helps you manage threads, avoid race conditions (where multiple threads access shared data incorrectly), and ensure proper synchronization for smooth program execution.
