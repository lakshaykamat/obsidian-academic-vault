# Computer Network Architecture

*Definition:* Computer Network Architecture is defined as the physical and logical design of the software, hardware, protocols, and media of the transmission of data. It essentially refers to how computers are organized and how tasks are allocated to the computer.

## Types of Network Architectures:

### 1 . Peer-To-Peer Network
   - A network in which all computers are linked together with equal privileges and responsibilities for processing data.
   - Suitable for small environments, typically up to 10 computers.
   - No dedicated server.
   - Special permissions are assigned to each computer for sharing resources, but issues may arise if the computer with the resource is down.

#### Advantages:
   - Less costly as it lacks a dedicated server.
   - If one computer stops working, others will not be affected.
   - Easy to set up and maintain as each computer manages itself.

#### Disadvantages:
   - Lacks a centralized system for data backup.
   - Security issues as each device manages itself.

### 2 . Client/Server Network
   - A network model designed for end users (clients) to access resources from a central computer (server).
   - The server performs major operations such as security and network management.
   - Responsible for managing all resources like files, directories, printers, etc.
   - Clients communicate with each other through the server.

#### Advantages:
   - Contains a centralized system, making data backup easy.
   - Dedicated server improves overall system performance.
   - Better security as a single server administers shared resources.
   - Increases the speed of sharing resources.

#### Disadvantages:
   - Expensive, requiring a server with large memory.
   - Network Operating System (NOS) cost is high.
   - Requires a dedicated network administrator to manage resources.
