# Topologies
Network topology refers to the layout or arrangement of the different elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a computer network. There are several types of network topologies, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some common network topologies:

1. [[bus-topologies|Bus Topology:]]
   - All devices share a common communication medium (a single cable).
   - Devices are connected to the bus cable using connectors or taps.
   - Cost-effective but can suffer from performance issues as more devices are added.

2. [[star-topologies|Star Topology:]]
   - All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
   - Hub or switch acts as a repeater for data flow.
   - Easy to install and manage, and if one connection fails, it doesn't affect the others.

3. [[ring-topologies|Ring Topology:]]
   - Devices are connected in a closed-loop or ring.
   - Data travels in one direction, passing through each device until it reaches its destination.
   - Reliability is high, but if one device or connection fails, the entire network can be affected.

4. [[mesh-topologies|Mesh Topology:]]
   - Every device is connected to every other device in the network.
   - High redundancy and reliability, but expensive and complex to set up and manage.
   - Provides multiple paths for data to travel, reducing the risk of network failure.

5. [[tree-topologies|Tree Topology:]]
   - A combination of star and bus topologies.
   - Groups of star-configured networks are connected to a linear bus backbone.
   - Scalable and can cover large areas, but the failure of the central hub can disrupt the entire network.

6. **Hybrid Topology:**
   - Combination of two or more different topologies.
   - Offers flexibility in design and can cater to specific organizational needs.
   - Complex but provides benefits of multiple topologies.

7. **Point-to-Point Topology:**
   - Direct connection between two devices.
   - Commonly used in WAN (Wide Area Network) connections.

8. **Mesh Topology (Wireless):**
   - Similar to wired mesh topology but with wireless connections between devices.
   - Provides flexibility and mobility but can face interference and security challenges.

The choice of a specific topology depends on factors such as the size of the network, budget constraints, scalability requirements, and the level of redundancy and reliability needed. Each topology has its strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice depends on the specific needs and constraints of the network environment.
