## Physical Layer
The physical layer is like the concrete foundation of a buildingâ€”it deals with the actual hardware and wires that let devices connect to each other, making sure they can send and receive signals over the network.

### Functions Of Physical layer
1. Transmits and receives raw data bits over a physical medium.
2. Defines cable types, connectors, and signaling methods.
3. Specifies network topology and interface characteristics.
4. Determines bit rate, bandwidth, and transmission modes.
5. Handles physical addressing (e.g., MAC addresses).
6. May include basic error detection mechanisms.
7. Serves as the foundation for higher OSI layers in communication systems.

### Protocols of Physical Layer
1. **Ethernet (IEEE 802.3):** Defines the physical and data link layers for wired local area networks (LANs).
2. **RS-232 (Recommended Standard 232):** A standard for serial communication between devices.
3. **USB (Universal Serial Bus):** A standard for connecting and powering devices through a cable.
4. **Bluetooth:** Wireless communication protocol for short-range data exchange between devices.
5. **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):** A technology for high-speed internet access over existing telephone lines.
6. **Fiber Optics:** Uses light signals transmitted through glass fibers for high-speed data transmission.
7. **Coaxial Cable:** A type of cable that carries data signals and is commonly used for cable television.
8. **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11):** Wireless networking standard for local area networks and internet access.
9. **NFC (Near Field Communication):** Enables short-range communication between devices for tasks like contactless payments.
10. **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):** An energy-efficient version of Bluetooth for low-power devices.
