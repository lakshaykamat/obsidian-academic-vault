## Session Layer
1. Session Management
2. Authentication
3. Authorization
The session layer is the fifth layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, ==responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions between applications on different devices.== It ensures coordination and synchronization between applications, allowing them to start, manage, and end conversations or sessions.

### Functions of session layer
1. Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between applications.
2. Controls dialog between applications, managing the flow of data for synchronized exchanges.
3. Manages token passing to avoid conflicts in network transmissions.
4. Ensures synchronization of data between communicating applications.
5. Implements checkpointing for session recovery in case of interruptions.
6. Manages duplexing, determining the direction of data flow in communication sessions.
