## Presentation Layer
The presentation layer is the sixth layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, focused on translating, encrypting, and formatting data to ensure that information exchanged between applications on different devices is understood and can be properly interpreted. It deals with the syntax and semantics of data, providing a common language for diverse systems.

### Functions of Presentation layer
1. Translates data between different systems for compatibility.
2. Encrypts and compresses data for security and efficient transmission.
3. Converts character sets and encoding formats for consistent representation.
4. Ensures syntax and semantics recognition for proper data interpretation.
5. Formats data for presentation to the application layer in a usable form.
6. Converts data formats between different network protocols for seamless communication.

### Protocols of Presentation Layer
1. **JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group):** Compresses and decompresses image files.
2. **MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group):** Encodes and compresses audio and video data for multimedia.
3. **GIF (Graphics Interchange Format):** A format for the storage and exchange of images.
4. **SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security):** Encrypts data for secure communication over a network.
5. **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):** Represents text characters using a standardized encoding.
6. **EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code):** Represents text characters, primarily used in IBM mainframes.
7. **Unicode:** A character encoding standard for representing text characters from multiple languages.
8. **JPEG 2000:** A compression standard for still images, an improvement over traditional JPEG.
9. **PNG (Portable Network Graphics):** A format for lossless image compression.
10. **ZIP:** A compression and archive format for bundling multiple files into a single file.
