## Data Link Layer
The data link layer is the second layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, responsible for reliable point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication between devices on the same network. It ensures error-free data transmission, organizes bits into frames, performs error detection, and manages access to the physical medium through techniques like MAC (Media Access Control) addressing.

### Functions of data link layer
1. Frames data for reliable transmission between devices.
2. Performs error detection to ensure data integrity.
3. Manages access to the physical medium through MAC addressing.
4. Establishes and terminates links between devices.
5. Handles flow control to prevent data congestion.
6. Provides a mechanism for addressing and identifying devices on the same network.

### Protocols of Data link Layer
1. **Ethernet:** Manages access to the physical medium and frames data for local network communication.
2. **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):** Establishes a direct connection between two devices over a serial link.
3. **HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control):** A bit-oriented protocol for communication over point-to-point and multipoint links.
4. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network.
5. **MAC (Media Access Control):** Controls access to the physical medium, assigning unique MAC addresses to devices.
6. **LLC (Logical Link Control):** Manages communication between devices on a local network.
7. **Frame Relay:** A protocol for efficient data transmission over wide area networks (WANs).
8. **Token Ring:** A local area network protocol that uses token passing for controlled access.
9. **SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol):** Supports communication over serial connections.
10. **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection):** Manages access to the network medium in Ethernet networks.
