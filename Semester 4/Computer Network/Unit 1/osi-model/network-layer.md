## Network Layer
The network layer is the third layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, and its primary role is to facilitate communication and data transfer between devices on different networks. It is responsible for logical addressing, routing, and forwarding packets from the source device to the destination device across multiple networks.

### Functions of network layer
1. Assigns logical addresses (e.g., IP addresses) to devices for identification.
2. Determines the optimal path for data packets to travel across multiple networks.
3. Manages the forwarding of packets from source to destination.
4. Utilizes packet-switching for efficient data transmission.
5. Enables communication between devices on different networks (internetworking).
6. Translates logical addresses to physical addresses for actual transmission.
7. Handles errors through detection and correction mechanisms.
8. Fragments and reassembles large packets for efficient transmission.
### Protocols of Network Layer
1. **IP (Internet Protocol):** Provides the addressing scheme and routing for data packets on the internet.
2. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** Sends error messages and operational information about network conditions.
3. **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol):** Manages membership in multicast groups on a network.
4. **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** A routing protocol for dynamically determining the best path for data packets.
5. **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** Manages routing between different autonomous systems on the internet.
6. **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** A simple routing protocol used in small to medium-sized networks.
7. **IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System):** A routing protocol used in larger and more complex networks.
8. **PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast):** Supports routing for multicast communication on a network.
9. **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security):** Provides security features, including encryption and authentication, for IP communication.
10. **ARPANET (Address and Routing Parameter Area NETwork):** An early network layer protocol that contributed to the development of the internet.
