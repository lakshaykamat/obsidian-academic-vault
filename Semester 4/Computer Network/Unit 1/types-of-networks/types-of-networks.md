# Types of networks
There are several types of networks, each designed to serve specific purposes and accommodate different scales of communication. Here are some common types of networks:

#### [[local-area-network|1. Local Area Network (LAN):]]
   - **Scope:** Limited geographic area (e.g., a single building, office, or campus).
   - **Purpose:** Enables devices within the same location to communicate and share resources efficiently.
   - **Characteristics:** High data transfer rates, low latency.

#### [[wide-area-network|2. Wide Area Network (WAN):]]
   - **Scope:** Extends over a large geographic area, potentially spanning cities, countries, or continents.
   - **Purpose:** Connects multiple LANs, facilitating long-distance communication.
   - **Characteristics:** Lower data transfer rates compared to LANs, higher latency.

### [[metropolitan-area-network|3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):]]
   - **Scope:** Covers a larger geographic area than a LAN but is smaller than a WAN (e.g., a city).
   - **Purpose:** Connects multiple LANs within a city for efficient data exchange.
   - **Characteristics:** Intermediate data transfer rates and latency.

### 4. Personal Area Network (PAN):
   - **Scope:** Very small, typically within the range of an individual person (e.g., within a room or personal devices).
   - **Purpose:** Connects personal devices like smartphones, laptops, and wearable devices.
   - **Characteristics:** Short-range communication, often using technologies like Bluetooth.

### 5. Campus Area Network (CAN):
   - **Scope:** Larger than a LAN but smaller than a MAN (e.g., a university campus or corporate campus).
   - **Purpose:** Connects multiple buildings or facilities within a specific area.
   - **Characteristics:** Designed for efficient communication within the campus boundaries.

### 6. Global Area Network (GAN):
   - **Scope:** Spans the entire globe or a significant portion of it.
   - **Purpose:** Facilitates global communication, often using satellite links and undersea cables.
   - **Characteristics:** Extremely large scale, with varying data transfer rates.

7. **Home Area Network (HAN):**
   - **Scope:** Covers a residential property.
   - **Purpose:** Connects devices within a home, including computers, smart devices, and entertainment systems.
   - **Characteristics:** Often wireless, with a focus on home automation and convenience.

8. **Storage Area Network (SAN):**
   - **Scope:** Dedicated network for high-speed data storage and retrieval.
   - **Purpose:** Connects storage devices, such as servers and disk arrays, to provide centralized storage resources.
   - **Characteristics:** High-speed data transfer, optimized for storage operations.

9. **Client-Server Network:**
   - **Architecture:** Based on a client-server model where clients request services or resources from servers.
   - **Purpose:** Efficiently distributes processing and resource management between clients and servers.

10. **Peer-to-Peer Network:**
    - **Architecture:** Devices in the network have equal status and can act as both clients and servers.
    - **Purpose:** Facilitates resource sharing and collaboration without a dedicated central server.
