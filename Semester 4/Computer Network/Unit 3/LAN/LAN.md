# LAN
A Local Area Network (LAN) is a group of interconnected computing devices that are confined to a limited geographical area, typically a single building or campus. LANs allow these devices to share resources, data and applications.
##### Characteristics
###### 1. Limited geographical area:
LANs cover a small distance, like a house, office, or school. This short distance allows for faster data transfer speeds and lower error rates.
###### 2. Device sharing:
LANs enable connected devices to share resources like printers, files, and applications. This can improve efficiency and productivity.
###### 3. Centralized internet connection (optional):
Many LANs have a single internet connection that all devices on the network can access. This is typically facilitated by a router.
###### 4. Wired or wireless connections:
Traditionally, LANs used wired connections like ethernet cables. However, wireless connections like Wi-Fi are becoming increasingly common.
###### 5. Security:
LANs can provide a higher level of security compared to public Wi-Fi networks because they are private.

##### Examples of LANs:
- A home network with multiple computers, phones, and tablets connected to a Wi-Fi router.
- An office network with desktop computers, laptops, and printers connected to a switch and router.
- A school network with computers in classrooms and a library connected to a central server.
