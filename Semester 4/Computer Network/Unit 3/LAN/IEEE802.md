# IEEE 802
IEEE 802 refers to a family of standards developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for local area networks (LANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), and wireless networks [IEEE 802]. This family of standards has a significant impact on how devices connect and communicate on networks we use every day.

Here's a breakdown of IEEE 802:

- **IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee:** This committee is responsible for overseeing the development and maintenance of the IEEE 802 standards [IEEE802].
- **Focus Areas:** The standards address various aspects of networking, including:
    - Physical Layer (PHY) specifications: This defines the electrical or optical characteristics of the network connection, like how data is encoded onto the cable.
    - Media Access Control (MAC) protocols: This governs how devices share the transmission medium and avoid collisions when sending data.
    - Logical Link Control (LLC) protocols: This layer provides services like error detection and correction for the network layer.

**Working Groups:** The IEEE 802 committee has different working groups that focus on specific networking technologies. Some of the most well-known working groups include:

- **IEEE 802.3 Ethernet:** This is the dominant standard for wired LANs, defining different variations of Ethernet with varying speeds (10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps and more).
- **IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi):** This group develops standards for wireless networking, defining different Wi-Fi generations (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax) with increasing speeds and capabilities.
- **IEEE 802.15 Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN):** This covers low-power, short-range wireless networks like Bluetooth.
- **Other Working Groups:** There are standards for wireless mesh networks, wireless body area networks (for wearable devices), and more.

Overall, the IEEE 802 standards play a crucial role in ensuring interoperability and compatibility between networking devices from different manufacturers. This allows us to connect our computers, phones, tablets, and other devices seamlessly on a network and share resources.
