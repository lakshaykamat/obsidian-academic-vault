# SONET (Synchronous Optical Network)

- **Development:** Developed in North America by ANSI (American National Standards Institute).
- **Functionality:** Defines standards for transmitting digital data streams over fiber optic cables at high speeds.
- **Hierarchy:** Utilizes a hierarchical structure where data is encapsulated in layers of frames and containers, ensuring efficient transmission and synchronization.
- **Transmission Speeds:** Offers various transmission speeds, with common ones being SONET OC-3 (155 Mbps) and SONET OC-12 (622 Mbps).

# SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy)

- **Development:** Developed by ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector) as an international standard.
- **Functionality:** Similar to SONET in functionality but with some key differences.
  - **Frame Structure:** Uses a slightly different frame structure with more overhead for additional features.
  - **Traffic Support:** Supports both synchronous and asynchronous traffic, offering more flexibility.
- **Transmission Speeds:** Designated as STM-1 (155 Mbps) and STM-4 (622 Mbps).

## Key Similarities

- Both SONET and SDH are used for high-speed data transmission over fiber optic cables.
- They utilize a layered framing structure for efficient data encapsulation and synchronization.
- Both offer a range of transmission speeds to cater to different network requirements.

## Key Differences

- SONET is a North American standard, while SDH is the international standard.
- SDH offers more flexibility by supporting both synchronous and asynchronous traffic.
- SDH has a slightly different frame structure with more overhead for additional features.

# In Essence

- Think of SONET and SDH as two sides of the same coin. They both achieve similar goals but cater to different regions and offer slightly different functionalities.
- Today, with globalization and the dominance of international standards, SDH is often the more common reference point.
