# What is TCP/IP
**TCP/IP** stands for **Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol**. It's not a single entity, but rather a **suite of communication protocols** that define how data is transmitted across computer networks, including the internet. It acts like a **common language** for devices, allowing them to understand and communicate with each other regardless of their specific make or model.

## key aspects of TCP/IP:
### 1. Foundation of the internet:
It forms the very basis of internet communication, establishing standardized rules that devices follow to connect and exchange information efficiently.
### 2. Suite of protocols:
While often referred to together, TCP/IP is actually a collection of individual protocols, each with a specific role in the communication process. The two most prominent ones are:
	**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** Ensures reliable data delivery. It breaks down data into manageable packets, guarantees their order of arrival, and acknowledges receipt. This is crucial for applications like file transfers or video streaming where data integrity is essential.
    - **Internet Protocol (IP):** Handles addressing and routing of data packets. It assigns unique IP addresses to devices, enabling them to identify and locate each other on the network.

- **Layered model:** TCP/IP can be visualized as a layered model, typically consisting of four or five layers, with each layer performing specific tasks related to data communication.
