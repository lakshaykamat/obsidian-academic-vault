# Internet Protocols
IP (Internet Protocol) is a set of rules governing how data packets are sent and received across networks. It assigns unique numerical addresses to devices for identification and communication.
Certainly! Here's a simplified breakdown in bullet points:

### Addressing:
  - IP ==assigns unique addresses== to devices on a network.
  - These addresses help devices find and communicate with each other.
  
### Routing:
  - IP ==breaks down data into packets== and adds source and destination addresses.
  - Routers use these addresses to guide packets through the network to their destination.

### Packet Format:
  - IP defines how data ==packets are structured.==
  - This ensures all devices can understand and process the information inside the packets.

### Versions:
  - IPv 4 has limited addresses (32-bit).
  - IPv 6 has more addresses (128-bit), accommodating more devices.

### Working with Protocols:
  - IP works with protocols like TCP for reliable data delivery.
  - TCP ensures packets arrive in order and without errors, while IP focuses on routing them.
