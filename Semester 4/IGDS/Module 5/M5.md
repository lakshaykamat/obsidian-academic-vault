Group Discussion (GD) is a common selection tool used by companies, educational institutions, and other organizations to assess candidates' communication skills, leadership abilities, and teamwork capabilities. GD topics are often categorized into three main types based on their content and nature: Factual Topics, Controversial Topics, and Abstract Topics. Let's explore each type:

### 1. Factual Topics:
Factual topics are based on concrete information, facts, and real-world scenarios. They often require candidates to analyze, discuss, and draw conclusions based on the given information. Examples include:
- Current Affairs: Discussing recent news events, social issues, or developments in politics, economy, technology, etc.
- Case Studies: Analyzing and discussing real-life business cases, problems, or scenarios to propose solutions.

- Scientific Discoveries: Discussing recent scientific breakthroughs, discoveries, or advancements in various fields.
- Historical Events: Analyzing the impact and significance of historical events, figures, or movements.

### 2. Controversial Topics:
Controversial topics are subjects that evoke strong opinions, debates, and differing perspectives among participants. They often touch upon sensitive issues, moral dilemmas, or ethical considerations. Examples include:
