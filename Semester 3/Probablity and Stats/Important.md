## Mean
Average value of a set. Types include arithmetic mean (add & divide), geometric mean (multiply & root), and harmonic mean (reciprocals).

## Expectation

Mathematical expectation, or expected value, is the average outcome of a random variable. For discrete variables, it's found by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing; for continuous variables, it involves integrating over all possible values.

**Discrete random variables:** (E[X]) = Σ (x * P(x))
**Continuous random variables:** (E[X]) = ∫ (x * f(x)) dx

State Addition theorem of expectation
