# Spatial databases
Spatial databases are specialized databases designed to efficiently store, manage, and query spatial or geographic data. They are capable of handling data associated with spatial attributes such as location, geometry, coordinates, distances, and relationships between geometric objects.

> Stores Geographic data.

### Key Aspects of Spatial Databases:

1. **Geometric Data Storage:** Spatial databases store geometric objects such as points, lines, polygons, and complex geometries used in geographic information systems (GIS).

2. **Spatial Indexing:** They employ spatial indexing structures (e.g., R-tree, Quadtree) to organize and efficiently access spatial data, enabling faster spatial queries and operations.

3. **Spatial Query Support:** Provide spatial query languages and specialized functions (e.g., distance calculations, containment checks, spatial joins) to perform spatial analysis and retrieve spatial information.

4. **Geospatial Analysis:** Spatial databases enable geospatial analysis, allowing users to perform tasks like proximity analysis, routing, geocoding, and spatial aggregation.

5. **Applications:** Widely used in various fields such as urban planning, environmental science, transportation, telecommunications, location-based services, and more.

### Examples of Spatial Databases:

1. **PostGIS:** An extension for PostgreSQL that adds support for geographic objects and spatial queries.

2. **Oracle Spatial and Graph:** Oracle's spatial database offering providing features for storing and analyzing spatial data.

3. **Microsoft SQL Server Spatial:** Microsoft's spatial database functionality for handling geographic data within SQL Server.

4. **GeoMesa:** An open-source spatial database built on top of Apache Accumulo, HBase, or Cassandra, designed for handling large-scale geospatial data.

### Benefits of Spatial Databases:

- **Efficient Spatial Queries:** They allow for optimized retrieval and analysis of spatial data, facilitating faster query performance.

- **Spatial Data Integrity:** Ensure consistency and integrity of spatial data by enforcing rules and constraints.

- **Integration with GIS:** Seamless integration with Geographic Information Systems for mapping, visualization, and spatial analysis.

- **Support for Standardized Formats:** Support for standard spatial data formats (e.g., Well-Known Text, GeoJSON) for interoperability.
