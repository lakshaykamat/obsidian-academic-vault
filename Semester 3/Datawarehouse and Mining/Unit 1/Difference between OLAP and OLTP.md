# Difference between OLAP and OLTP
| Aspect              | OLAP                                       | OLTP                                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**         | Analytical processing for complex querying and data analysis. | Transaction processing for day-to-day operations. |
| **Functionality**   | Facilitates complex, read-intensive queries for data analysis. | Handles routine, write-intensive transactional operations. |
| **Type of Queries** | Supports complex, ad-hoc, and read-heavy queries. | Executes simple, standardized, and write-intensive queries. |
| **Data Usage**      | Utilizes historical and aggregated data for analysis. | Focuses on current and transactional data for real-time operations. |
| **Database Design**  | Employs denormalized data models, multidimensional structures (star, snowflake schemas). | Uses normalized data models to ensure data integrity and transactional efficiency. |
| **Data Size**       | Handles large volumes of data, often historical or aggregated. | Manages smaller datasets, emphasizing real-time transactional data. |
| **Optimization**    | Optimized for read efficiency and complex query performance. | Optimized for write efficiency and transaction throughput. |
| **Usage Scenario**  | Suited for business intelligence, decision-making, and analytical reporting. | Suited for order processing, inventory management, and transaction recording. |
