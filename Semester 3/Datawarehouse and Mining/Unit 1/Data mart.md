A data mart is a ==specialized subset of a data warehouse==, focusing on a particular *department or user group's needs*, offering filtered, aggregated data tailored for faster, department-specific analytics and decision-making within an organization.

- Subset of a data warehouse
- Tailored for specific departments
- Contains focused and aggregated data
- Supports faster departmental analytics
- Designed for specific user group needs

## Reasons to create data marts
1. **Departmental Focus:** Tailoring data for specific departmental needs.
2. **Faster Access:** Providing quicker access to relevant information.
3. **Simplified Analysis:** Offering focused data for easier analysis.
4. **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Supporting quicker and informed decisions.
5. **Improved Performance:** Optimizing queries for department-specific analytics.
6. **Customization:** Meeting unique user group requirements efficiently.
7. **Specialized Reporting:** Enabling specialized reports for specific business areas.
8. **Agility:** Enhancing agility in departmental data analysis.
9. **Reduced Complexity:** Minimizing complexity for user-specific data usage.

## Advantages of data mart

## Disadvantages of data mart
1. **Data Silos:** Fragmentation can lead to isolated pockets of information.
2. **Inconsistency:** Data discrepancies due to separate data management.
3. **Limited Scope:** Might overlook broader organizational insights.
4. **Integration Challenges:** Difficulty in aligning with other data sources.
5. **Duplication:** Risk of redundant data across different data marts.
6. **Maintenance Overhead:** Managing multiple separate systems.
7. **Scalability Issues:** Might face limitations in accommodating growth.
8. **Costly Redundancy:** Incurs additional costs for duplicated efforts.
9. **Complexity in Governance:** Challenges in unified governance.
10. **Lack of Enterprise View:** May miss holistic organizational insights.


## Types of Data mart
### Dependent Data Mart
- Derived directly from an enterprise data warehouse (EDW).
- Relies entirely on the EDW for data and follows the same schema and structure.
- Offers a subset of data from the centralized data warehouse, tailored for specific departmental needs.

> Dependent data mart is **created with the help of data warehouse**
### Independent Data Mart  
- Developed separately from the enterprise data warehouse.
- Extracts data directly from source systems instead of the centralized data warehouse.
- Offers more autonomy and control over data structures and content but may lack consistency with other data marts or the EDW.

 > Independent Data mart is **created without the help of data warehouse**
