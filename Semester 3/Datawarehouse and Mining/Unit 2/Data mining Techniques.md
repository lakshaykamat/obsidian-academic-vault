# Data mining techniques
Data mining techniques encompass various methods and algorithms used to extract patterns, knowledge, or insights from large datasets. 

These techniques are employed to uncover hidden relationships, trends, anomalies, and valuable information within the data. 
Here are some common data mining techniques:

1. **Classification:**
   - **Decision Trees:** Hierarchical structures used to classify data based on a series of decisions.
   - **Naive Bayes:** Statistical method based on Bayes' theorem to predict the class of unknown instances.
   - **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Classifies data by finding an optimal hyperplane that separates classes.

2. **Clustering:**
   - **K-Means:** Divides data into K clusters based on similarity measures.
   - **Hierarchical Clustering:** Forms clusters hierarchically by merging or splitting clusters.
   - **DBSCAN:** Clusters data based on density, suitable for irregularly shaped clusters.

3. **Association Rule Mining:**
   - **Apriori Algorithm:** Discovers frequent itemsets and association rules among items in transactional databases.

4. **Regression Analysis:**
   - **Linear Regression:** Predicts a continuous variable's value based on other variables' linear relationship.
   - **Logistic Regression:** Predicts the probability of a categorical variable's occurrence.

5. **Anomaly Detection:**
   - **Statistical Methods:** Utilizes statistical models to identify outliers or anomalies in data.
   - **Clustering-Based Approaches:** Detects anomalies based on deviation from typical clusters.

6. **Neural Networks:**
   - **Deep Learning:** Utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns in data.

7. **Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
   - **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes text to determine sentiment or opinions.
   - **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifies and classifies named entities (e.g., names, dates, locations) in text.

8. **Dimensionality Reduction:**
   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces data dimensions while retaining important information.
   - **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE):** Visualizes high-dimensional data in lower dimensions.

9. **Ensemble Methods:**
   - **Random Forest:** Utilizes multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
   - **Gradient Boosting:** Builds models sequentially to correct errors made by previous models.

10. **Time Series Analysis:**
	-  **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** Models and forecasts time series data.
