DMQL is designed for data mining tasks, enabling the retrieval, manipulation, and analysis of data stored in databases or other repositories.

1. **Data Selection:**
    - Users can specify which data records or attributes to include in the analysis.
2. **Data Transformation:**
    - DMQL supports preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to prepare data for mining.
3. **Mining Task Definition:**
    - Users can specify the type of analysis to perform, such as decision tree construction, clustering, or association rule discovery.
4. **Mining Parameter Configuration:**
    - Configuration of settings for data mining algorithms, including parameters like support and confidence thresholds for association rule mining.
5. **Results Retrieval:**
    - DMQL allows users to extract patterns, rules, or models generated by the data mining process.
6. **Flexibility and Variability:**
    - Syntax and capabilities of DMQL may vary based on the data mining software or platform, with different tools implementing their own query languages or extensions to standard SQL.
In summary, DMQL serves as a specialized language for efficiently conducting data mining operations on large datasets, providing a structured approach from data selection to result extraction.
