# Requirement Engineering
Requirement Engineering (RE) is the systematic process of eliciting, analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing software requirements throughout the software development lifecycle.

1. **Elicitation:** Gathering and identifying stakeholders' needs, expectations, and constraints to define requirements.

2. **Analysis:** Examining and understanding collected requirements to ensure they are feasible, complete, and consistent.

3. **Documentation:** Recording and documenting requirements in a clear and understandable manner for stakeholders and development teams.

4. **Validation:** Verifying and validating requirements to ensure they align with stakeholder needs and are achievable within constraints.

5. **Management:** Controlling changes, tracking requirements, and ensuring their traceability throughout the development process.

## Requirement Engineering Process
1. Feasibility Study
2. Requirement Elicitation and Analysis
3. Software Requirement Specification
4. Software Requirement Validation
5. Software Requirement Management
### Requirement Engineering Process:

1. **Feasibility Study:**
    - **Objective:** The objective behind the feasibility study is to create the reasons for developing the software that is acceptable to users, flexible to change and conformable to established standards.
    - **Types of Feasibility:**
        - **Technical Feasibility:** Assess current technologies required to meet customer requirements within time and budget.
        - **Operational Feasibility:** Evaluate the software's ability to solve business problems at various levels.
        - **Economic Feasibility:** Decide if the software can generate financial profits.

3. [[Software requirement specification]]
    - **Objective:** Document collected requirements in a format understandable by the development team.
    - **Tools and Models Used:**
        - **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs):** Show the flow of data through a system.
        - **Data Dictionaries:** Store information about data items defined in DFDs.
        - **Entity-Relationship Diagrams:** Represent data entities, relationships, and attributes.

4. **Software Requirement Validation:**
    - **Objective:** Validate requirements against practicality, correctness, completeness, and ambiguity.
    - **Validation Techniques:**
        - **Requirements Reviews/Inspections:** Systematic manual analysis of requirements.
        - **Prototyping:** Creating an executable model to check requirements.
        - **Test-Case Generation:** Developing tests for requirement verification.
        - **Automated Consistency Analysis:** Checking consistency of structured requirement descriptions.

5. **Software Requirement Management:**
    - **Objective:** Manage changing requirements during the development process.
    - **Challenges:**
        - **New Requirement Emergence:** Business needs evolve, leading to new requirements.
        - **Changing Priority:** Requirements' priority shifts during development.
        - **Evolution of Business Environment:** External factors impact system development.
