**Linking** is the process of combining multiple separately compiled code modules into a single executable program. It's an essential step in the software development process. Linking can be done in two ways: static linking and dynamic linking.

1. **Static Linking:** In static linking, all the necessary code from libraries is copied into the final executable at compile-time. This results in a self-contained executable, but it can lead to larger file sizes and multiple instances of the same code if multiple programs use the same libraries.

2. **Dynamic Linking:** Dynamic linking means that the code from libraries is not copied into the final executable. Instead, references to the libraries are included in the executable, and the actual linking happens at runtime. This approach results in smaller executables and allows multiple programs to share the same code in memory.

Dynamic linking is advantageous in terms of reducing memory usage and facilitating updates to shared libraries without recompiling programs that use them.

# What is Dynamic Linking

**Dynamic linking** is a technique used in software development where the code of a program is linked to external libraries or modules at runtime rather than at compile-time. In dynamic linking, the program includes references to the external libraries, and the actual linking and loading of these libraries occur when the program is executed.

Here are some key points about dynamic linking:
1. **Efficient Memory Usage:** Dynamic linking saves system memory because the code from external libraries is loaded into memory only when it is needed, reducing memory consumption.

2. **Easy Updates:** It allows for easier updates to shared libraries. When a shared library is updated, all programs that use it can benefit from the update without needing to be recompiled.

3. **Runtime Flexibility:** Dynamic linking provides runtime flexibility, as it enables the program to adapt to changes or updates in external libraries without requiring a new build.

4. **Modular Design:** It supports a modular design, where multiple programs can share common libraries, reducing redundancy and disk space usage.

# Difference Between Stattic and Dynamic Linking

| Aspect                  | Static Linking                                        | Dynamic Linking                                       |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Linking Time            | Performed at compile-time.                           | Performed at runtime.                                |
| Library Inclusion       | All necessary libraries are copied into the executable, resulting in a larger executable file. | External libraries are referenced, and the actual linking occurs when the program is launched, leading to smaller executables. |
| Memory Usage            | Consumes more memory as all code is included in the executable. | More memory-efficient as only the code that is actively used is loaded into memory. |
| Updates and Changes     | Requires recompilation of the entire program when libraries are updated or changed. | Allows for easier updates to shared libraries without recompiling the program. |
| Flexibility             | Less flexible in adapting to changes without recompilation. | More flexible, enabling runtime adaptation to changes in libraries. |
| Modular Design          | Each program has its own copy of the libraries, potentially leading to redundancy. | Supports shared libraries, reducing redundancy and disk space usage. |
