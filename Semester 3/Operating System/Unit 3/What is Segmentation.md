Segmentation is a memory management technique used in operating systems to divide the computer's physical memory into different segments or sections based on logical groupings of data. Unlike paging, which divides memory into fixed-size pages, segmentation allows for variable-sized memory segments, each with its own specific purpose.

In segmentation, each segment represents a different part of a program or data, such as code, data, stack, and heap. The key aspects of segmentation include:

1. **Logical Separation:** Segmentation provides a logical separation of memory based on the needs of the program, which is often more reflective of the program's structure compared to paging.
2. **Protection:** Segmentation allows for the enforcement of memory protection and access rights, preventing one segment from accessing or modifying the contents of another.
3. **Dynamic Growth:** Segments can dynamically grow or shrink, allowing for more flexible memory allocation compared to fixed-size paging.
4. **Address Mapping:** A segment table is used to map logical addresses to physical addresses, providing the necessary translation.
