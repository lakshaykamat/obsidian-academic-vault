# Paging
Paging is a memory management technique used in operating systems to manage the allocation of memory to processes. It involves breaking up the physical memory into fixed-size blocks called pages. The process of retrieving processes in the form of pages from secondary storage (e.g., a hard disk) into the main memory is known as paging. Each page is the same size, and it simplifies memory allocation and management.

Key features of paging in an operating system include:

1. **Fixed-Size Pages:** The physical memory is divided into fixed-size pages, and the same size pages are used for both physical and logical addresses.
2. **Efficient Use of Memory:** Paging reduces internal fragmentation as pages are of uniform size. However, it may lead to external fragmentation if the available memory is not contiguous.
3. **Ease of Address Translation:** Paging uses a page table to map logical addresses to physical addresses, enabling efficient address translation.
4. **Simplifies Memory Allocation:** The operating system manages the allocation and deallocation of pages, simplifying the memory allocation process.

Paging is particularly useful in systems where processes have varying memory requirements. It offers several advantages, including efficient use of memory and ease of address translation, making it a commonly used memory management technique in modern operating systems.
