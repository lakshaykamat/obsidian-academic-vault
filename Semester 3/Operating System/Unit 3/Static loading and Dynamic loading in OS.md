Static loading and dynamic loading are two different approaches to loading programs and their associated libraries in an operating system. Here's a brief explanation of each:

## Static Loading
Static loading refers to loading the entire program, including all its modules and libraries, into the main memory before execution. This means that all the necessary components are loaded into memory at the beginning, and the program can run independently without further loading.
   
## Dynamic Loading
Dynamic loading is a mechanism where a program loads specific modules or libraries into memory on demand, as they are needed during the program's execution. In this approach, only the required code and data are loaded into memory when they are needed, which can help save system resources.

## Difference Between Static and Dynamic Loading

| Aspect                  | Static Loading                                      | Dynamic Loading                                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Loading Process        | Entire program is loaded into memory before execution. | Only required modules and libraries are loaded as needed during execution. |
| Memory Usage            | Typically consumes more memory as all components are loaded upfront. | More memory-efficient as only necessary components are loaded. |
| Start Time             | Longer start-up time as everything is loaded initially. | Faster start-up time due to on-demand loading. |
| Resource Utilization   | May result in underutilization of resources as some components may not be used. | Efficient resource utilization as unused components are not loaded. |
| Flexibility            | Less flexible in adapting to changes or updates without relaunching the program. | More flexible and adaptable to updates without relaunching. |
| Security               | Potentially less secure as all components are present in memory. | Can be more secure as only necessary components are loaded, reducing the attack surface. |
