Operating system that involves the management, scheduling, and control of processes within a computing environment. 
A process is an executing instance of a program that includes the program code, data, and various resources required for its execution. Here's an overview of process management:

## Key Elements of Process Management:
- **Process Creation:** Starting new processes via program execution or system calls.
- **Process Termination:** Halting processes upon task completion or due to errors.
- **Process Scheduling:** Efficiently assigning CPU time using scheduling algorithms.
- **Process State Transitions:** Managing states and transitioning between them based on events.
- **Process Synchronization:** Ensuring synchronized access to shared resources.
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Enabling data exchange between processes.
- **Process Control Block (PCB):** Storing vital process information in a structured format.

## Importance of Process Management:
- Efficient process management ensures optimal utilization of system resources, including the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
- It allows for multitasking and parallel execution of multiple programs, enhancing system responsiveness and user experience.
- Proper process management ensures fairness, responsiveness, and efficient sharing of resources among different processes running simultaneously on the system.
