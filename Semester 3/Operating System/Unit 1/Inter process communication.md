# Inter process communication
- **IPC Purpose:** Facilitates data exchange and synchronization among concurrent processes.
- **Message Passing:** Processes share data through messages using queues or direct communication.
- **Shared Memory:** Allows processes to share a common memory segment for swift data exchange.
- **Pipes and FIFOs:** Enable communication between related processes through data flow.
- **Sockets:** Facilitate process communication over networks using network sockets.
- **Advantages:** Supports data exchange, resource sharing, and synchronization between processes.
- **Importance:** Essential for collaborative tasks, enhancing system functionality and resource optimization.

### Methods of IPC:
1. **Message Passing**
	- Processes exchange data through messages using shared message queues or direct communication.
2. **Shared Memory**
	- Allows processes to share a common memory segment for fast data exchange.
3. **Pipes and FIFOs**
	- Enable communication between related processes through a unidirectional or bidirectional flow of data.
4. **Sockets**
	- Facilitate communication between processes over a network using network sockets.

## Advantages of IPC
- **Data Exchange:** Allows processes to share information and cooperate on tasks.
- **Resource Sharing:** Facilitates the sharing of resources between processes.
- **Inter-Process Coordination:** Aids in synchronization and coordination among concurrent processes.

## Importance:
- **Collaborative Tasks:** IPC enables processes to work together, enhancing functionality.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Allows multiple processes to share resources, optimizing system efficiency.
