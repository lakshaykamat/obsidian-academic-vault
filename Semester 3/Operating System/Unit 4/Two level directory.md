- Each user has their own UFD (user file directory)
### Advantages
- More than two files can have same name
- Prevent user to access other user's files
- Searching will easy
### Disadvantages
- User can't share files with others
- User can't create sub-directories
- Scalability can't possible because one user can't group the same type of files together
