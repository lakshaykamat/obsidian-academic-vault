# Hard Disk Architecture
![hard disk](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/images/Chapter10/10_01_DiskMechanism.jpg)
A hard disk drive (HDD) is a data storage device that uses rotating platters to store digital information. HDD's are the most common type of secondary storage device in use today.
## Components of a Hard Disk Drive
- **Platters:** These are the circular disks that store data. Platters are typically made of aluminium or glass and are coated with a magnetic material.
- **Spindle:** The Spindle is a motor that spins the platters at a high speed. This spinning motion is what allows the read/write heads to access the data on the platters.
- **Read/write heads:** These are the devices that read and write data to the platters. Read/write heads are mounted on an arm that moves them across the surface of the platters.
- **Actuator arm:** This is the arm that moves the read/write heads across the surface of the platters. The actuator arm is controlled by a motor that is located on the circuit board
- **Circuit board:** The circuit board contains the electronics that control the hard disk drive. The circuit board also contains the connectors that allow the hard disk drive to communicate with the computer.
## Advantages of Hard Disk Drives
- Low Cost
- High Capacity
- Durability
## Disadvantages of Hard Disk Drives
- Slow speed
- Noise
- Fragility (easy to damage)
