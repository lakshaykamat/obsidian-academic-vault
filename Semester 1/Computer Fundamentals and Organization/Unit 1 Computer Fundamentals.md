# Unit 1 Computer Fundamentals

# Computer

A computer is an electronic device that can process data, perform calculations, and perform other operations based on instructions provided by a user or a program. It is capable of accepting input, processing it, and producing output. 

The three main components of a computer are the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and input/output devices. The CPU is the "brain" of the computer and is responsible for executing instructions, while memory is used to store data and instructions. 

Input/output devices, such as a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, are used to interact with the computer. There are different types of computers, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, which vary in terms of size, processing power, and capabilities.

# Generation of Computer

Computers can be divided into generations based on technological advancements and improvements.

## First Generation Computer

The first generation of computers, also known as the vacuum tube era, lasted from the late 1940s to the late 1950s. These computers used vacuum tubes as electronic switches and were large in size, consumed a lot of power, and generated a lot of heat.

Examples of first-generation computers include the UNIVAC, the IBM 701, and the EDSAC. They were mainly used for scientific and military purposes, and were not widely available to the general public.

## Second Generation Computer

The second generation of computers, also known as the transistor era, lasted from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s. These computers replaced vacuum tubes with transistors, which were smaller, more reliable, and consumed less power. They also used magnetic core memory, which was more efficient and reliable than the earlier used electrostatic storage. 

Examples of second-generation computers include the IBM 1401, the UNIVAC 1108, and the Ferranti Atlas. They were used in a wide range of applications, including business, government, and scientific research. They were also more widely available to the general public, and were used in schools and universities.

## Third Generation Computer

The third generation of computers, which lasted from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s, was characterized by the use of integrated circuits (ICs) instead of transistors. ICs are small chips that contain many transistors and other components, and allowed for even more compact and powerful computers. These computers also had improved input-output devices and could run multiple programs at the same time. 

Examples of third-generation computers include the IBM System/360, the CDC 6600, and the Univac 1108 II. They were used in a wide range of applications, including business, government, and scientific research, and became increasingly available to the general public.

## Fourth Generation Computer

The fourth generation of computers, which began in the late 1970s and continues to the present day, is characterized by the use of microprocessors. A microprocessor is a small chip that contains the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer, and allows for even more compact and powerful computers. These computers also had improved input-output devices and memory capacity and also made it possible to create personal computers (PCs) that were affordable and accessible to the general public. 

Examples of fourth-generation computers include the IBM PC, the Apple Macintosh, and the Commodore 64. These computers have been widely used in a wide range of applications, including business, government, education, and personal use.

# Flash Memory

Flash memory is a type of non-volatile storage technology that is used in a variety of electronic devices such as smartphones, digital cameras, USB drives, and solid-state drives (SSD) for computers. It gets its name from the way data is written to the memory, known as "flash programming."

Flash memory stores data in memory cells, which are made up of floating-gate transistors. These transistors can hold a charge, which represents the binary data of 1 or 0. Because the data is stored in the transistors, it does not require power to maintain it, unlike dynamic RAM (DRAM) which lose data when power is not supplied.

Flash memory has several advantages over traditional magnetic storage devices such as hard drives. It is more durable, as there are no moving parts that can break. It also has faster read and write speeds, which makes it more suitable for use in devices that require quick access to stored data. Additionally, flash memory is small, lightweight, and consumes less power than traditional storage devices.

It is also worth mentioning that flash memory can be also classified as NOR and NAND flash memory, based on the way data is stored on its transistors, this classification is important in terms of the performance, cost and end-application of the technology.
