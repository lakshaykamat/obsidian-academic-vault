# World Wide Web

The World Wide Web (WWW or Web) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed via the internet. It is a way to access, retrieve, and share information and resources over the internet.

The Web is built on a set of technologies, such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript, that are used to create and format web pages. These technologies allow web pages to be created with text, images, videos, and other multimedia content, as well as links to other web pages.

Web pages are accessed using a web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. Users enter a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the browser's address bar, which tells the browser the address of the web page they want to access. The browser then sends a request to the web server hosting the page, which sends the page back to the browser to be displayed.

# Web Browser

A web browser is a software application that allows users to access, retrieve and display web pages and other information on the Internet. Web browsers are the most common way to interact with the World Wide Web (WWW).

Web browsers work by sending requests for web pages to web servers using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) and then displaying the received web pages on the user's device. The web pages are rendered using technologies such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript.

# Searching the WWW

Searching the World Wide Web (WWW) is the process of finding web pages and other information on the Internet that match a specific set of keywords or phrases. This can be done using a search engine, which is a specialized software system designed to help users find information on the Web.

There are many search engines available, such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo, that provide a way to search the web. To search the web, a user typically enters keywords or phrases into a search box on the search engine's website, and the search engine returns a list of relevant web pages and other information that match those keywords.

# Search Engine

A search engine is a specialized software system that helps users find information on the Internet. It works by indexing the content of web pages, and then allowing users to search for specific keywords or phrases.

When a user enters a search query into a search engine, the search engine uses its algorithms to search its indexed content and return a list of relevant web pages and other information that match the query. The results are usually ranked by relevance and are displayed in a list, with the most relevant results appearing at the top.

Search engines use a variety of techniques to index and rank web pages, including:

1. **Crawling:** This is the process of automatically visiting web pages and following links to other pages in order to discover and index new content.
2. **Indexing:** This is the process of analyzing the content of web pages and extracting relevant information such as keywords, headings, and meta data.
3. **Ranking:** This is the process of determining the relevance of web pages based on factors such as the number and quality of links pointing to a page, the relevance of the page's content to the search query, and the relevance of the page's content to the user's location, language, and other factors.

# TELNET and FTP

1. **Telnet:** Telnet is a protocol that allows users to remotely connect to a computer and control it as if they were sitting in front of it. It uses a virtual terminal connection to provide a command-line interface for users to access remote systems. Telnet is typically used for remote system administration, network troubleshooting, and remote access to UNIX-based systems.
2. **FTP:** FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. FTP is a protocol that allows users to transfer files between computers on a network. It is commonly used to upload and download files to and from a server. FTP uses two channels to transfer files, one for control and the other for data transfer. FTP can be used to transfer files between computers running different operating systems and it can also be used to transfer files between a client and a server.

Both Telnet and FTP are considered insecure protocols because they transmit data in plain text and therefore are vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering. Therefore, it's recommended to use SSH or SFTP which are more secure alternatives to Telnet and FTP.

Telnet and FTP are among the oldest and most widely used internet protocols. They are still in use today for various purposes but have been largely replaced by more secure alternatives.
