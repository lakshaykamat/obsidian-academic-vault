# Unit 4 Goal Setting

# Wish List

A wish list is a collection of items, experiences, or goals that an individual would like to have or achieve in the future. Wish lists can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

1. **Gift-giving:** A wish list can be shared with family and friends to help them select an appropriate gift for a special occasion such as a birthday or holiday.
2. **Personal development:** A wish list can be used to set and achieve personal goals related to health, career, finances, or education.
3. **Travel:** A wish list can be used to plan and organize a dream vacation or bucket list of travel destinations.
4. **Career:** A wish list can be used to list the type of position, company or working conditions that an individual is seeking.
5. **Home and lifestyle:** A wish list can be used to plan and organize home improvements, furniture or lifestyle changes such as gym memberships or yoga classes

Creating a wish list can be a helpful tool for setting and achieving goals, as it allows individuals to be clear and specific about what they want and to prioritize their desires. It also can act as a reminder of things to work towards and can be reviewed periodically to see the progress made or the changes in priorities.

It's worth noting that wish lists can be personal and private, but can also be shared with others. Some people may share their wish lists with friends and family, for example, for gift-giving or for accountability in achieving goals. It is ultimately up to the individual to decide whether or not to share their wish list.

# SMART Goals

SMART goals are a widely used method for setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals. The acronym stands for:

1. **Specific:** The goal should be clear and specific, answering questions such as what, why, who, where, and which.
2. **Measurable:** The goal should be quantifiable, allowing you to track your progress and measure your success.
3. **Achievable:** The goal should be realistic and achievable, taking into account your available resources and constraints.
4. **Relevant:** The goal should be relevant to your overall well-being and align with your values and priorities.
5. **Time-bound:** The goal should have a deadline or time frame, giving you a sense of urgency and a clear endpoint.

- "I will increase my annual income by 20% in the next 12 months by taking on freelance work and increasing my rates."
- "I will improve my public speaking skills by giving two presentations per quarter in the next 6 months."

# Short Term and Long-Term Goals

Short-term goals and long-term goals are two types of goals that individuals may set for themselves over the course of their lifetime.

Short-term goals are objectives that can be achieved within a relatively short period of time, usually within a few months to a year. These types of goals are often specific, measurable, and action-oriented, and are focused on achieving a specific outcome or reaching a particular milestone. Examples of short-term goals include:

- Saving a certain amount of money for a vacation
- Losing a certain number of pounds
- learning a new skill in a specific period of time
- Planning to buy a car

Long-term goals are objectives that are intended to be achieved over a longer period of time, usually several years or even decades. These types of goals tend to be more ambitious and may require more planning, effort, and persistence to achieve. Examples of long-term goals include:

- Building a successful career
- Buying a house
- paying off a mortgage
- Building a family
- Planning for retirement
- Starting a business

It's important to note that short-term goals often serve as stepping stones towards achieving long-term goals, so it's important to balance the two and not neglect either, also it's good to set realistic goals and review them regularly to ensure they are still aligned with your values and priorities.
