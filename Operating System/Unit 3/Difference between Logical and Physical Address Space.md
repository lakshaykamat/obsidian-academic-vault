| Aspect | Logical Address Space | Physical Address Space |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | Set of all logical addresses generated by the CPU for a program. | Set of all physical addresses mapped to the actual hardware memory. |
| Generation | Generated by the CPU while the program is running. | Computed by the Memory Management Unit (MMU) or hardware memory management. |
| View | User can view the logical address space of a program. | User cannot directly view the physical address space; it's hidden from the program. |
| Address Mapping | Logical addresses are mapped to physical addresses by the MMU during memory access. | No mapping is required as physical addresses directly correspond to hardware memory locations. |
| Abstraction Level | Provides an abstraction layer, allowing programs to work with symbolic addresses. | Operates at the hardware level, dealing with actual memory locations. |
| Flexibility | Allows for dynamic relocation and protection through address translation. | Less flexible, as physical addresses are fixed by hardware. |
| Impact on Programs | Logical address space facilitates program portability and dynamic loading. | Programs rely on the fixed physical memory layout, limiting portability. |
