-   Significantly different from the advanced and multi functional operating systems we use today
- They were primitive, with limited capabilities and functionalities.

# Batch Processing Systems
## Characteristics
- Primarily used punch cards or tapes for input and output.
- Operated in batch mode, where similar jobs were grouped together and executed sequentially.
- Lack of interactivity and direct user control; users submitted jobs for processing without direct interaction with the system.
## Example
IBM 700 Series, UNIVAC I, and other early mainframe computers.

# Time-Sharing Systems

## Characteristics
- Enabled multiple users to interact with the computer simultaneously through terminals.
- Utilized time-sharing techniques to give each user a small time slice of the CPU for their tasks.
- Allowed for interactive computing, facilitating simultaneous use by multiple users.
## Examples
- Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service), Unix (developed at Bell Labs), and some early versions of mainframe operating systems.

# Multiprogramming Systems
## Characteristics 
- Allowed multiple programs to reside in memory simultaneously.
- Utilized CPU scheduling techniques to switch between programs, aiming for increased CPU utilization.
## Examples    
- IBM OS/360, which introduced the concept of multiprogramming.

# Real-Time Operating Systems
## Characteristics
- Designed for applications that require immediate response times and deterministic behavior.
- Prioritized timely execution of tasks over throughput.
## Examples
- RTOSes like OS-9 and VxWorks, developed for embedded systems and specialized applications.
