Statistical data can be categorised into two main types based on the sources utilised
# Primary Data

- Firsthand information obtained through methods such as surveys, experiments, or observations.
## Direct Personal interviews
| Merits | Demerits |
| ------------ | -----------------
| High response rates due to personal interaction. | Time-consuming and expensive, especially for large samples. |
| Allows for clarification of questions and better rapport. | Possibility of interviewer bias or influence on responses. |

## Indirect Oral Interviews
| Merits | Demerits |
| ------------ | -----------------
| Offers anonymity to respondents, potentially encouraging honest responses. | Lack of personal interaction may result in lower response rates. |
| Less intimidating for sensitive topics compared to face-to-face interviews. | Limited ability to clarify questions or seek further information. |

## Information from Correspondents
| Merits | Demerits |
| ------------ | -----------------
| Collects data from diverse geographical locations or sources. | Relies on the willingness and accuracy of correspondents.
| Cost-effective as it does not require direct interaction. | May face delays or inaccuracies in information provided. |

## Mailed Questionnaire Method
| Merits | Demerits |
| ------------ | -----------------
| Cost-effective for large-scale surveys. | Low response rates compared to other methods.
| Allows respondents to answer at their convenience. | No opportunity for clarification or follow-up on responses. |

## Schedules Sent Through Enumerators
| Merits | Demerits |
| ------------ | -----------------
| Offers more control and supervision over data collection. | Can be time-consuming and expensive due to the need for trained enumerators.
