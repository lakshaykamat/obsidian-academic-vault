# Genetic Algorithm

A **Genetic Algorithm** (GA) is an adaptive heuristic search inspired by *Darwin's theory of evolution*, widely used to solve complex optimization problems in machine learning. GAs are beneficial for tasks requiring efficient and adaptable solutions, such as electronic circuit design, code-breaking, image processing, and artificial creativity.

### Key Terminologies in Genetic Algorithms
- **Population**: A subset of all possible solutions that can solve a given problem.
- **Chromosome**: A single solution in the population, made up of genes.
- **Gene**: An element of a chromosome representing a particular characteristic or variable in the solution.
- **Allele**: The value of a gene within a chromosome.
- **Fitness Function**: Measures an individual’s ability to solve the problem, determining its likelihood of selection.
- **Genetic Operators**: Processes that modify the next generation, including:
   - **Selection**: Choosing individuals to reproduce based on their fitness.
   - **Crossover**: Combining genes from two parents to create offspring.
   - **Mutation**: Introducing random changes to maintain diversity.

### Genetic Algorithm Workflow

The GA follows an evolutionary cycle to generate high-quality solutions through five main phases:

1. **Initialization**
   - The algorithm begins by creating a random initial population of individuals (solutions), often represented as binary strings.

2. **Fitness Assignment**
   - Each individual’s fitness is evaluated using a fitness function. The fitness score determines an individual's likelihood of being selected for reproduction—the higher the fitness, the higher the chance of selection.

3. **Selection**
   - Selection involves choosing individuals to reproduce offspring, using methods such as:
      - **Roulette Wheel Selection**
      - **Tournament Selection**
      - **Rank-Based Selection**

4. **Reproduction**
   - Two operators work here:
      - **Crossover**: A crossover point is selected randomly within the genes, and parent genes are swapped to form new offspring.
         - Types: *One-point crossover, Two-point crossover, Uniform crossover*
      - **Mutation**: Random genes are inserted to keep genetic diversity, preventing premature convergence.
         - Types: *Flip bit mutation, Gaussian mutation, Swap mutation*

5. **Termination**
   - The algorithm terminates when a stopping criterion (such as a threshold fitness score) is met, identifying the final solution as the best in the population.

### Differences Between Genetic and Traditional Algorithms
| **Feature**              | **Genetic Algorithm**                     | **Traditional Algorithm**            |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Search Space**         | Multiple solutions in search space       | Single solution in search space      |
| **Search Requirements**  | Only requires an objective function      | Needs extensive problem-specific information |
| **Parallel Capability**  | Can work in parallel                     | Sequential                           |
| **Solution Operation**   | Operates on solution representations     | Operates directly on candidate solutions |
| **Result Generation**    | Can produce multiple solutions           | Yields a single solution             |
| **Optimal Result**       | Likely to approach optimal results       | Does not ensure an optimal solution  |
| **Nature**               | Probabilistic and stochastic             | Deterministic                        |

This probabilistic and evolutionary approach makes genetic algorithms powerful for complex, real-world optimization problems where traditional methods may fall short.
