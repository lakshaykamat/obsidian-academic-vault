# Novelty and Utiltiy
**Novelty** and **Utility** are two key criteria for determining whether an invention can be patented.

1. **Novelty**:
   - **Definition**: Novelty means that the invention must be new or original. It must not have been disclosed or known to the public in any form before the patent application.
   - **Purpose**: The idea is to prevent patents on things that are already known, ensuring only truly original inventions are protected.
   - **Example**: If a scientist creates a new compound that no one has discovered or used before, it meets the novelty requirement.

2. **Utility**:
   - **Definition**: Utility means that the invention must have a useful purpose. It should be functional and beneficial in some way, providing a practical use.
   - **Purpose**: This criterion prevents patents on inventions that are merely theoretical or without real-world application.
   - **Example**: A new type of medical device that improves patient care has clear utility. However, if an invention has no practical purpose or is simply impractical, it may fail this requirement.

For an invention to be patentable, it must be both *new (novel)* and *useful (utility)*.
