### **Interconnections Between WIPO, WTO, GATT, and TRIPS**

1. **WIPO and WTO**:  
   While WIPO focuses on the promotion and protection of IP, the WTO incorporates IP into its broader trade framework through TRIPS. Both organizations work toward the same goal of facilitating trade and fostering innovation but from different angles.

2. **GATT and TRIPS**:  
   GATT served as the foundation for trade agreements prior to the establishment of the WTO. With the advent of TRIPS under the WTO, intellectual property has become an integral part of international trade discussions, reflecting the growing recognition of IP's role in economic development.

3. **TRIPS and WIPO Treaties**:  
   TRIPS complements WIPO treaties by setting minimum protection standards, ensuring that member countries comply with the principles of the Berne and Paris Conventions, and enhancing the enforcement of IP rights globally.

### **Conclusion**

WIPO, WTO, GATT, and TRIPS are crucial components of the international intellectual property and trade landscape. They work together to create a balanced system that promotes innovation, trade, and economic development while ensuring that IP rights are respected and enforced globally.
