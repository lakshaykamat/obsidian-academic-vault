# Patent Act: Overview and Key Amendments
### **Purpose of the Patent Act**
The Patent Act provides a legal structure to protect inventions. It grants inventors exclusive rights to their inventions for a set time (usually 20 years), allowing them to prevent others from making, using, or selling the invention without permission.

### **Eligibility for Patents**
To be eligible for a patent, an invention must:
- Be **novel** (new and original).
- Include an **inventive step** (non-obvious).
- Be **industrially applicable** (practical for industry use).

### **Patent Application Process**
1. **Filing**: Inventors or their representatives submit a patent application to the patent office.
2. **Examination**: The application is reviewed to ensure it meets patent eligibility requirements.
3. **Grant**: If the invention qualifies, a patent is granted, offering exclusive rights for a specified time.

### **Rights and Enforcement**
- **Exclusive Rights**: Patents allow inventors to control the use of their inventions for 20 years.
- **Enforcement**: Patent holders can take legal action against unauthorized use or infringement.
