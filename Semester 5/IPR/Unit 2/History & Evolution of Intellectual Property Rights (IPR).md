# History & Evolution of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)

The concept of intellectual property dates back centuries, initially emerging in medieval Europe. The term "Intellectual Property" was first used in a 1769 publication in *The Monthly Review*. Over time, patents, copyrights, and trademarks evolved globally and locally, with distinct milestones in England, the United States, and India.

### **1. Patents**

- **Global Evolution**: Patents date back to 1331, with King Edward III of England granting one of the first recorded patents to John Kemp, a Flemish weaver, who received exclusive rights to his wool weaving technique. These early patents evolved from “letters patent,” where monarchs granted temporary monopolies on various industries. However, over time, misuse by monarchs led to reforms, and the *Statute of Monopolies* (1624) limited the Crown's powers, laying the groundwork for modern patent laws.
  
- **India’s Development**: India’s first patent legislation was Act VI of 1856, encouraging inventors to disclose inventions. This law evolved over time, culminating in the **Patents Act, 1970**, which is the foundation of India’s modern patent law.

### **2. Copyrights**

- **Global Evolution**: Copyrights began as a way for governments to control printed materials. In 1710, the *Statute of Anne* marked a turning point, establishing author rights with a limited 28-year protection period before works entered the public domain. Copyright laws were later enacted in the U.S. (1790) and France (1793).
  
- **India’s Development**: India adopted copyright law in 1847 under the East India Company, followed by the British-influenced 1914 Copyright Law. Post-independence, India enacted its own **Copyright Act in 1957**, aligning with the Berne Convention. This act has undergone several amendments, the latest in 2012.

### **3. Trademarks**

- **Global Evolution**: Trademarks have origins in 13 th-century England, where bakers used unique marks to distinguish their products. The first modern trademark legislation emerged in France in 1857, followed by England’s *Merchandise Marks Act* in 1862. The UK’s first registered trademark was in 1876 by the Bass Brewery.
  
- **India’s Development**: India’s first trademark law, the **Trademark Act of 1940**, was influenced by British law. Post-independence, the **Trade and Merchandise Act, 1958** and later the **Trade Marks Act, 1999** further strengthened trademark protection.
