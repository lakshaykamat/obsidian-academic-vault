# **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**

**Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)** refers to a company’s commitment to operate in an ethical and sustainable manner by considering its impact on society, the environment, and the economy. It involves going beyond profit-making to contribute positively to societal goals, such as improving the quality of life for employees, communities, and society at large, while minimizing the environmental footprint.

CSR is an integral part of modern business strategy, emphasizing that businesses have a responsibility to their stakeholders—including employees, customers, suppliers, the environment, and the communities in which they operate—beyond mere legal and financial obligations.
