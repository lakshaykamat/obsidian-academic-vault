### **Functions of Management**

Management involves a series of interconnected activities that help an organization achieve its goals effectively and efficiently. The functions of management are the core activities that guide managers in organizing and controlling resources. These functions were first identified by **Henri Fayol**, and they remain central to modern management theory. The primary functions of management are:

---

### 1. **Planning**

**Planning** is the process of setting goals, defining strategies, and outlining tasks and schedules to accomplish the objectives of an organization. It is the first step in the management process, laying the foundation for all other functions.

#### Key Aspects of Planning:
