   - *Example*: Believing that hard work leads to career advancement.
2. **Affective Component**: Reflects emotions or feelings about something.
   - *Example*: Feeling motivated and happy about a challenging project.
3. **Behavioral Component**: Reflects the intention or action taken as a result of the belief or emotion.
   - *Example*: Putting in extra effort to succeed in a role you feel positively about.

#### Functions of Attitudes in OB
- **Adjustment**: Helps employees adapt to work demands and align with organizational goals.
- **Ego-Defense**: Allows individuals to maintain self-esteem by defending against negative feelings.

### 3. Emotions

Emotions are intense, short-lived feelings that arise in response to specific events or interactions. They can influence decision-making, productivity, and interpersonal relations in the workplace.

#### Types of Emotions in OB
- **Positive Emotions**: Include happiness, satisfaction, enthusiasm, and pride. These emotions tend to improve teamwork, motivation, and problem-solving.
- **Negative Emotions**: Include anger, frustration, fear, and stress. While sometimes unavoidable, these emotions can lead to conflicts, reduce motivation, and affect mental health if not managed.

#### Emotional Intelligence (EI)
Emotional Intelligence is the ability to recognize, understand, manage, and respond to one’s own emotions and those of others. It has four main components:
1. **Self-Awareness**: Recognizing one’s emotions and how they affect others.
2. **Self-Regulation**: Managing emotions in a constructive way.
3. **Social Awareness**: Understanding others’ emotions and perspectives.
4. **Relationship Management**: Using emotional awareness to manage interactions effectively.

**Example in OB**: A manager with high EI can recognize when an employee is feeling overwhelmed and provide support, such as additional resources or encouragement, to maintain productivity and morale.
