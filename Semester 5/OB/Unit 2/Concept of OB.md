# Concept of Organizational Behavior (OB)

Organizational Behavior (OB) is the study of how people behave within organizations. It focuses on understanding and managing human behavior to improve employee performance, satisfaction, and the overall effectiveness of an organization.

### Key Areas of OB

1. **Individual Behavior**  
   OB looks at how individuals within the organization (employees, managers, supervisors, and workers) act and interact with others. It examines factors such as:
   - Personal motivation
   - Job satisfaction
   - Decision-making styles
   - Communication skills

2. **Group Behavior**  
   OB also studies behavior in group settings. This includes understanding how teams and groups operate within the organization and what affects their performance and dynamics. Topics covered include:
   - Teamwork and collaboration
   - Group decision-making
   - Leadership within groups
   - Group norms and roles

### Why OB Matters
Understanding OB helps managers and leaders:
- Motivate employees effectively
- Improve communication
- Foster teamwork and collaboration
- Build a positive organizational culture

By understanding individual and group behavior, organizations can create environments where employees are more productive, engaged, and satisfied.
