### What is Stress?

**Stress** is the body’s reaction to demands or pressures that disrupt its normal balance. It can be triggered by external factors (e.g., workload, deadlines) or internal factors (e.g., self-expectations, personal beliefs).

- **Positive Stress (Eustress)**: A moderate level of stress that can be motivating, such as the drive to meet a challenging deadline.
- **Negative Stress (Distress)**: High levels of stress that become overwhelming, leading to anxiety, exhaustion, and health issues.

**Example**: An employee feeling the pressure of a tight project deadline may feel eustress that motivates them to work efficiently. However, if the deadline seems unrealistic or the workload is too high, this can turn into distress.
