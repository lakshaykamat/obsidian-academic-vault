# OOPS
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects" which can contain data (attributes or properties) and code (methods or functions). The fundamental idea behind OOP is to model real-world entities as software objects, allowing for a more organized, modular, and scalable approach to building software systems.

### Key principles of object-oriented programming include:

1. **Objects:** Objects are instances of classes. They encapsulate data and behavior together. Each object has its own set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.

2. [[Classes]] Classes act as blueprints or templates for creating objects. They define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have. Objects are instances of these classes.

3. [[Encapsulation]] Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods within a class. It hides the internal state of an object and restricts access to it, allowing controlled interaction through methods. This helps in maintaining data integrity and prevents unintended modifications.

4. [[Abstraction]] Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on real-world entities or concepts. It focuses on essential properties and behavior while hiding unnecessary details.

5. [[Inheritance]] Inheritance allows a class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.

6. [[Polymorphism]] Polymorphism refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same superclass. It allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably based on their shared superclass, enabling flexibility and code extensibility.
