**_I think studying integration and differentiation never ends._** 

_They are too complex, and in exams, questions don't cover much beyond Leibniz's theorem, partial differentiation, differentiation, Bernoulli's formula, double and triple integration._ 

> So, why give them so much importance? 

**_We have to pass the exam first._** 

_Let's focus on matrix and the theory of equations; they are not as difficult as these two and are also scoring subjects._
