| Thu | 14 Dec 23 | 2   | GEC-DS-2    | Software Engineering            |

Based on my analysis, we have continuous exams on _December 7th, 8th, and 9th_. On the 8th, we have Semester 1 exams for Algebra and Calculus, which I am least prepared for at the moment. We currently have **8 days left**, and if I allocate 1 day for preparing for the Python exam, we'll have a total of 7 days remaining. Within this time frame, I need to prepare for two exams: Algebra and Calculus and Data Warehouse and Mining

> I have to prepare for two exams within the next 8 days.

### [[27-11-2023|27 November]]
I have a lot to do tonight and tomorrow. On the [[29-11-2023|29th of November]], I have to go to college because they are announcing that all students have to pay their fees, and practicals will be conducted. So, the 29th of November will be busy at college. Tomorrow night, on the [[28-11-2023|28th of November]], I will be busy with a wedding.
