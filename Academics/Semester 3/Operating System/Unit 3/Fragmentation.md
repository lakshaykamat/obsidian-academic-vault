# Fragmentation
Fragmentation in the context of operating systems and memory management refers to the inefficient use of memory space. It occurs when memory is divided into small blocks or segments, and over time, these blocks become fragmented, leading to wasted or unusable memory. There are two main types of fragmentation:

## Internal Fragmentation
This type of fragmentation occurs when memory blocks are allocated to a process more significant than their requested size. As a result, there is unused space within allocated memory blocks, leading to inefficiency.

## External Fragmentation
External fragmentation happens when there are small gaps or unused memory space between allocated memory blocks. These gaps are not large enough to accommodate a new process, causing memory to be underutilized.
