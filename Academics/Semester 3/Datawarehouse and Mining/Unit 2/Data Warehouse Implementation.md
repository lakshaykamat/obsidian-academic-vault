### 1. Requirements analysis and capacity planning
The first process in data warehousing involves _defining enterprise needs, defining architectures, carrying out capacity planning, and selecting the hardware and software tools._ This step will contain be consulting senior management as well as the different stakeholder.
### 2. Hardware integration
Once the hardware and software has been selected, they require to be put by _integrating the servers, the storage methods,_ and the user software tools.

### 3. ModellingÂ 
Modelling is a significant stage that involves designing the warehouse _schema and views._ This may contain using a modeling tool if the data warehouses are sophisticated.

### 4. Physical modeling
For the data warehouses to perform efficiently, physical modeling is needed. This contains designing the _physical data warehouse organization, data placement, data partitioning, deciding on access techniques, and indexing_.

### 5. Sources
The information for the data warehouse is likely to come from several data sources. This step contains _identifying and connecting the sources using the gateway, ODBC drives, or another wrapper._

### 6. ETL
The data from the source system will require to go through an _ETL phase._ The process of designing and implementing the ETL phase may contain defining a suitable ETL tool vendors and purchasing and implementing the tools. This may contains customize the tool to suit the need of the enterprises.

### 7. Populate the data warehouses:
Once the ETL tools have been agreed upon, testing the tools will be needed, perhaps using a staging area. Once everything is working adequately, the ETL tools may be used in populating the warehouses given the schema and view definition.

### 8. User applications
For the data warehouses to be helpful, there must be end-user applications. This step contains designing and implementing applications required by the end-users.

### 9. Roll-out the warehouses and applications
Once the data warehouse has been populated and the end-client applications tested, the warehouse system and the operations may be rolled out for the user's community to use.
