1. **Data Selection:**
   - Choosing the relevant dataset(s) from various sources based on the problem domain and objectives.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and preparing the data by handling missing values, outliers, and resolving inconsistencies.

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Transforming or encoding data to suit the requirements of algorithms, including normalization or standardization.

4. **Data Mining Algorithm:**
   - Applying specific data mining algorithms (e.g., decision trees, clustering, neural networks) to extract patterns or insights from the preprocessed data.

5. **Pattern Evaluation:**
   - Evaluating the discovered patterns or models to assess their accuracy, significance, and reliability using metrics or validation techniques.

6. **Knowledge Presentation:**
   - Presenting the analyzed patterns or insights in a comprehensible and actionable format to aid decision-making or further analysis.
