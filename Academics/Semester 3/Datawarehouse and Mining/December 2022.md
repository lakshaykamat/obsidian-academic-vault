## What is metadata repository in data warehousing?
A metadata repository in data warehousing _stores descriptive information_ about data sources, structures, definitions, relationships, and transformations. 

It serves as a centralized catalog or database, enabling management, organization, and understanding of data assets within the data warehouse environment.

## What is meant by concept hierarchy? Explain its need.
A concept hierarchy organizes data in a structured manner, presenting it at varying levels of detail or abstraction. 

It enables efficient data organization, analysis, and navigation, aiding in query optimization, data summarization, visualization, and better business understanding. Ultimately, it facilitates effective handling and comprehension of complex datasets.

## What is bitmap indexing?
Bitmap indexing is a method in databases where bit arrays represent column values, aiding faster query processing for low-cardinality columns.

It condenses data into bitmaps, enabling efficient retrieval by performing bitwise operations, but may be inefficient for high-cardinality columns and can impact write operations

> Imagine you have a big table with information, like a list of students and their favorite subjects. Bitmap indexing is like making a separate list for each subject and marking down which students like that subject. Then, when you want to know which students like both Math and Science, you just look at the Math list and the Science list and see where they both have a mark. It helps find information quickly by using these lists instead of looking through the whole big table every time.

## Describe various methods for data cube materialization
Imagine your sales data as a big puzzle. A data cube helps look at this puzzle from different angles: sales by region, time, and product. Now, think of how you'd set up these angles:

1. **Full Materialization:** You solve the whole puzzle in advance for all views and keep them stored, ready to show. It takes up lots of space but allows instant viewing from any angle.
    
2. **Partial Materialization:** Instead of solving the entire puzzle, you solve only parts you often use. It saves space, but sometimes you must solve a part when asked, taking a little more time.
    
3. **On-the-Fly Aggregation:** You don't solve anything in advance. When someone wants a specific view, you solve that part quickly. It saves space but might be slower when someone wants a less common view.

## What are Decision trees how they assist in classifying data? explain with the help of suitable example
Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They operate by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the most significant attributes, creating a tree-like structure that assists in decision-making.

### How Decision Trees Assist in Classifying Data:

1. **Splitting Data:** Decision trees start by identifying the most important attribute in the dataset that best separates or divides the data into distinct groups. This process continues, creating branches or nodes based on different attributes at each level.

2. **Classification:** At each node, the decision tree algorithm chooses the attribute that best splits the data into pure or homogenous subsets (those with similar class labels).

3. **Example:** Consider a simple example of classifying whether to play outdoor sports based on weather conditions. The decision tree might start by choosing the attribute "outlook" (e.g., sunny, rainy, overcast) to divide the dataset into subsets based on different weather outlooks.

   - **First Split:** If the outlook is "sunny," it might further split the data based on humidity or other attributes.
   - **Second Split:** For "rainy" outlook, the tree might split based on windy conditions or temperature.
   - **Outcome:** Eventually, the tree forms branches that lead to classification decisions, such as playing or not playing sports.

4. **Leaf Nodes and Decision Making:** The process continues until a stopping criterion is met, forming leaf nodes that represent the final decision or classification.

5. **Classification Rules:** Each path from the root node to a leaf node represents a set of classification rules based on attribute conditions.

### Advantages
- Easily interpretable, providing transparent decision-making paths.
- Handles both categorical and numerical data.
- Requires minimal data preprocessing.

### Limitations
- Can overfit with complex trees.
- Sensitive to small changes in data.
- May not handle irrelevant attributes well.
