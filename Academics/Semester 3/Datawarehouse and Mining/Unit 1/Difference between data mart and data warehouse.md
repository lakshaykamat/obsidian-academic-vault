# Difference between data mart and data warehouse

| Aspect                  | Data Mart                               | Data Warehouse                            |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**               | Subset focused on a specific department or user group's needs. | Comprehensive, storing enterprise-wide data. |
| **Data Content**        | Contains a specialized set of data, tailored for specific analysis within a department. | Stores vast amounts of integrated and historical data from multiple sources. |
| **Purpose**             | Supports specific, localized business needs or departmental analytics. | Serves as a centralized repository for broader organizational analytics and decision-making. |
| **Size**                | Smaller in size, with a more limited scope and less extensive data coverage. | Larger and more expansive, covering various departments and comprehensive data sets. |
| **Schema Design**        | Often follows a simpler schema design, focused on specific user group requirements. | Utilizes complex, highly normalized or dimensional schemas to support enterprise-wide reporting and analytics. |
| **Deployment Speed**     | Faster to deploy due to its smaller and more targeted nature. | Slower to deploy due to its complexity and broader data coverage. |
| **Flexibility**          | More flexible and agile, catering to specific departmental needs. | Less agile due to its larger scope and complexity, often requiring more planning for changes. |
| **Costs**                | Generally lower in cost due to its smaller size and focused nature. | Higher costs associated with the comprehensive integration and management of extensive data. |
| **Integration**          | Easier to integrate due to its narrower focus and targeted data content. | More challenging to integrate due to diverse data sources and extensive data coverage. |
| **Example Use Case**     | Sales data mart for the Sales department's analytics. | Enterprise-wide data warehouse for overall business intelligence and analysis. |
