| **Definition**            | Analyzing an existing product or system to understand its design and function without access to its original specifications or documentation. | Redesigning and redeveloping an existing system to improve its quality, performance, or functionality. |
| **Purpose**               | To comprehend how something works or to replicate it without having access to its original design documents or knowledge. | To enhance existing systems by optimizing code, improving features, or restructuring to meet modern requirements. |
| **Focus**                 | Understand the design, structure, and functionality of an existing product. | Improve and optimize an existing system's performance, quality, or functionality. |
| **Process**               | Dissecting the product, studying its components, and creating new models or documentation based on the analysis. | Analyzing the current system, identifying inefficiencies, and redesigning it for improved results. |
| **Objective**             | Understanding the workings of a product or system for replication or further development. | Improving or optimizing an existing system's performance, often involving significant changes. |
