### Requirements Elicitation Techniques:

1. **Interviews:**
   - **Objective:** Understand customer expectations.
   - **Approaches:**
     - *Open-ended:* No pre-set agenda, uses context-free questions.
     - *Structured:* Follows a prepared agenda or questionnaire.

2. **Brainstorming Sessions:**
   - **Objective:** Generate new ideas and share viewpoints.
   - **Key Aspects:**
     - Group technique fostering creativity.
     - Facilitated by a skilled moderator.
     - Documented ideas for review and prioritization.

3. **Facilitated Application Specification Technique (FAST):**
   - **Objective:** Bridge expectation gaps between developers and customers.
   - **Approach:**
     - Participants list system components and functions.
     - Sub-teams create mini-specifications.
     - Draft specifications compiled from all inputs.

4. **Quality Function Deployment (QFD):**
   - **Objective:** Prioritize requirements valuable to customer satisfaction.
   - **Types of Requirements:**
     - *Normal:* Goals and objectives of the software.
     - *Expected:* Implicit requirements.
     - *Exciting:* Features beyond expectations.

   - **Steps:**
     - Identify stakeholders and their requirements.
     - Assign importance value to each requirement.
     - Categorize requirements based on achievability.

5. **Use Case Approach:**
   - **Objective:** Provide functional understanding through text and diagrams.
   - **Components:**
     - *Actor:* External agent interacting with the system.
       - *Primary:* Seeks system assistance.
       - *Secondary:* Provides system assistance.
     - *Use Cases:* Sequence of interactions between actors and the system.
     - *Use Case Diagram:* Graphical representation of actor-system interactions.
       - Actor: Stick figure.
       - Use Case: Oval.
       - Relationship: Line.

### Features of Requirements Elicitation:

1. **Stakeholder Engagement:**
   - Engaging stakeholders like customers, end-users, and experts for understanding their needs.

2. **Gathering Information:**
   - Collecting data about the system, supporting business processes, and end-user requirements.

3. **Requirement Prioritization:**
   - Assigning importance to requirements based on project success.

4. **Requirements Documentation:**
   - Clearly documenting requirements for easy understanding and communication.

5. **Validation and Verification:**
   - Ensuring requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs.

6. **Iterative Process:**
   - Continuously refining and updating requirements based on stakeholder feedback.

7. **Communication and Collaboration:**
   - Effective interaction among stakeholders, project team, and relevant parties.

8. **Flexibility:**
   - Adapting to changing requirements, stakeholder needs, and project constraints.

### Advantages of Requirements Elicitation:

- Clarifies and refines customer requirements.
- Enhances communication and collaboration.
- Increases the likelihood of meeting customer needs.
- Prevents misunderstandings and manages expectations.
- Identifies risks early in the development cycle.
- Facilitates accurate project planning.
- Builds stakeholder confidence in the process.
- Identifies new business opportunities.

### Disadvantages of Requirements Elicitation:

- Time-consuming and expensive.
- Requires specialized skills and expertise.
- Susceptible to changing business needs.
- Influenced by political and organizational factors.
- May lack stakeholder buy-in and commitment.
- May face conflicting priorities and interests.
- May result in incomplete or inaccurate requirements.
- Can escalate development costs if requirements are unclear.

**Problems of Elicitation and Analysis**

- Getting all, and only, the right people involved.
- Stakeholders often don't know what they want
- Stakeholders express requirements in their terms.
- Stakeholders may have conflicting requirements.
- Requirement change during the analysis process.
- Organizational and political factors may influence system requirements.
