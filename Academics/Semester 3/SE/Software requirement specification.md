# Software requirement specification
Software Requirement Specification (SRS) is a detailed document outlining the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system. It serves as a blueprint for developers, guiding them throughout the software development lifecycle.

### Components of an SRS Document:

1. **General Description:**
   - **Objective:** Describes the product's general functions, user objectives, characteristics, and importance.
   - **Features:** Outlines the product's features, benefits, and user community characteristics.

2. **Functional Requirements:**
   - **Objective:** Details the expected outcome of the software system, explaining functional requirements in a ranked order.
   - **Explanation:** Specifies system behavior, relationships between inputs and outputs, and detailed descriptions of inputs and their sources.

3. **Interface Requirements:**
   - **Objective:** Describes software interfaces and communication methods among programs or users (language, code, messaging).
   - **Examples:** Shared memory, data streams, or other communication means.

4. **Performance Requirements:**
   - **Objective:** Explains how the software performs under specific conditions, detailing time, memory, error rates, etc.
   - **Types:** Static (not impacting execution characteristics) and Dynamic (constraints on execution behavior).

5. **Design Constraints:**
   - **Objective:** Specifies limitations or restrictions for the design team, such as algorithms, hardware, or software limitations.
   - **Factors:** Client environment, standards, resource limits, operating environment, reliability, and security requirements.

6. **Non-Functional Attributes:**
   - **Objective:** Details non-functional attributes for optimal software performance (e.g., security, portability, reliability).
   - **Examples:** Application compatibility, data integrity, scalability capacity, reusability.

7. **Preliminary Schedule and Budget:**
   - **Objective:** Provides an initial project plan version, including time duration and overall cost estimation for development.

8. **Appendices:**
   - **Objective:** Contains additional information such as references, definitions of specific terms, acronyms, and abbreviations.

### Uses of the SRS Document:

- **Development Team:** Guides product development according to specific needs.
- **Testing Group:** Basis for generating test plans according to the described external behavior.
- **Maintenance and Support Staff:** Understands the intended functionalities and behavior of the software product.
- **Project Manager:** Basis for planning schedules, effort, and resource allocation.
- **Customers:** Relies on it to understand the expected product.
- **Contract:** Serves as a contract between the developer and the customer.
- **Documentation:** Essential for documentation purposes.
