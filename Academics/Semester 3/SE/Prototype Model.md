# Prototype Model
The Prototype Model is an iterative software development approach that focuses on building prototypes or early, scaled-down versions of the final software system. 

It involves creating a working model of the software to gather user feedback and refine requirements.

1. **Prototype Creation:** Develop an initial prototype with basic functionality based on gathered requirements.

2. **User Evaluation:** Present the prototype to users, stakeholders, or clients to gather feedback and identify potential improvements or modifications.

3. **Refinement:** Based on feedback, refine the prototype by adding or modifying features, enhancing usability, or addressing issues.

4. **Iteration:** Repeat the cycle of building, evaluation, and refinement until the final product satisfies requirements and stakeholders' needs.

## Characteristics
- **Iterative:** Multiple iterations of prototyping, each improving based on user feedback.
- **Quick Development:** Rapid creation of prototypes to validate and refine requirements.
- **User Involvement:** Active participation of users throughout the development process.
- **Flexible and Adaptive:** Embraces changes and modifications easily.

## Advantages
- Early identification of user requirements and design flaws.
- Increases user involvement and satisfaction by incorporating their feedback.
- Facilitates risk reduction by addressing issues early in the development cycle.
- Supports better alignment with user needs through continuous refinements.

## Disadvantages
- Possible scope creep due to continuous changes.
- Challenges in managing evolving requirements.
- May not be suitable for projects with tight schedules or strict budget constraints.
