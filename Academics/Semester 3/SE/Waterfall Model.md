# Waterfall Model
The Waterfall model is a sequential software development process, structured in a linear and rigid manner, progressing through defined phases:

1. **Requirements:** Gather and document all project requirements extensively before moving to the next phase.

2. **Design:** Develop a comprehensive system design based on gathered requirements.

3. **Implementation:** Actual coding or development of the software using the design specifications.

4. **Testing:** Verify and validate the software against the documented requirements to detect defects or issues.

5. **Deployment:** Install the software in the live environment after successful testing.

6. **Maintenance:** Provide ongoing support, updates, and fixes after the software is deployed.

## Characteristics
- **Sequential:** Each phase depends on the completion of the previous one.
- **Rigid and Linear:** No room for revisiting phases once completed.
- **Document-Driven:** Emphasizes extensive documentation for each phase.
- **High-Level Planning:** Predetermined and structured planning before execution.
- **Less Adaptive to Changes:** Difficult to accommodate changes once in the development process.

## Advantages
- Clear structure and documentation at each stage.
- Easy to understand and manage due to its sequential nature.
- Suitable for well-defined, stable requirements.

## Disadvantages
- Not flexible to accommodate changes late in the development process.
- High risk of customer dissatisfaction if initial requirements are inaccurate.
- Testing at the end might lead to late detection of issues.
