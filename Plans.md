| Fri | 8 Dec 23  | 1   | BCA-DS-104  | [[Algebra and Calculus]]            |
| Sat | 9 Dec 23  | 1   | BCA-DS-204  | Data warehouse and mining       |
| Tue | 12 Dec 23 | 3   | BCA-17-204B | Environmental Science           |
| Thu | 14 Dec 23 | 2   | GEC-DS-2    | Software Engineering            |

Based on my analysis, we have continuous exams on _December 7th, 8th, and 9th_. On the 8th, we have Semester 1 exams for Algebra and Calculus, which I am least prepared for at the moment. We currently have **8 days left**, and if I allocate 1 day for preparing for the Python exam, we'll have a total of 7 days remaining. Within this time frame, I need to prepare for two exams: Algebra and Calculus and Data Warehouse and Mining

> I have to prepare for two exams within the next 8 days.
