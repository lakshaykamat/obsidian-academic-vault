# Regression

Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of regression analysis is to find the best fit line (or curve) that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

Regression analysis can be used to answer questions such as:

- How does changing one or more independent variables affect the dependent variable?
- Can we predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables?
- How strong is the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable?

There are several types of regression analysis, including:

1. **Linear Regression:**
Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation. The goal is to find the line that best fits the data points and minimizes the distance between the line and the data points.
2. **Multiple Regression:**
Multiple regression is used when there are two or more independent variables that are related to the dependent variable. The goal is to find the best fit line that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.
3. **Logistic Regression:**
Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is categorical, such as yes or no, or true or false. The goal is to find the best fit line that can predict the probability of the dependent variable being in one category or the other.
4. **Polynomial Regression:**
Polynomial regression is used when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is not linear but can be approximated by a polynomial equation.

# Data Science Companies

In recent years, data science has become a critical component of many businesses, leading to the creation of new companies that focus on data-driven solutions. Here are a few examples of companies that have started in data science:
